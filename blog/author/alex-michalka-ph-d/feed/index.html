					<description><![CDATA[<p>When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, or the “Fed”) meets to weigh changing the federal funds rate, as it does eight times each year, the resulting decision invariably makes headlines. That’s because the federal funds rate (or the rate at which banks loan money to one another) can have big implications for financial markets [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Back in the spring, the stock market appeared to be in free-fall. From the April 2 &#8220;Liberation Day” tariff announcements to April 8, the S&#38;P 500® dropped by about 12%. Then, on April 9, the S&#38;P 500® had its best single-day gain in about 17 years. And by early summer, as the likely magnitude of [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Financial markets are always unpredictable, and that’s been especially true so far in 2025. After early April volatility related to early tariff announcements that included the biggest single-day drop in the S&#38;P 500® since 2020, the US stock market rebounded and ended the first half of the year at an all-time high. Then, just a [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Something interesting happened in the US stock market in mid-May: Despite significant volatility this spring, on May 13, the broad US stock market (as represented by the Vanguard Total Stock Market index fund, VTI) returned to the same level where it started the year, and through June 4 it is up 1.22% year to date.

If you’re one of the many people who find market volatility to be unnerving, this is probably a relief.

No investor, whether they’re new to investing or have been making deposits for years, likes to see the value of their portfolio go down—even if it’s just temporary.
