					<description><![CDATA[<p>Back in the spring, the stock market appeared to be in free-fall. From the April 2 &#8220;Liberation Day” tariff announcements to April 8, the S&#38;P 500® dropped by about 12%. Then, on April 9, the S&#38;P 500® had its best single-day gain in about 17 years. And by early summer, as the likely magnitude of [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Financial markets are always unpredictable, and that’s been especially true so far in 2025. After early April volatility related to early tariff announcements that included the biggest single-day drop in the S&#38;P 500® since 2020, the US stock market rebounded and ended the first half of the year at an all-time high. Then, just a [&#8230;]</p>

Over the last several weeks, financial markets have been volatile because of uncertainty about the impact and extent of tariffs.
