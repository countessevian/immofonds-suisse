Now I have one for each of them.<\/p>\n<p><b>Get Ahead of the Chaos Parenthood Brings<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Since launching our own 529 College Savings Plan, we have spoken with many clients who found clever ways to save on taxes today, while simultaneously saving more towards their future financial goals. These clients know that one of the beautiful things about 529s is that, whether you already have a child today or not, you can open an account and start stashing away hard earned money for <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/213200706-What-expenses-are-considered-qualified-higher-education-expenses-\">qualified higher educational expenses<\/a>, while letting it grow tax free with compounding returns. This is because 529s allow you to change the beneficiary on the account (with some exclusions) at any time without penalty, so long as they are a family member. Below are examples of creative ways some of our clients are investing with us.<\/p>\n<p><i>Save now for the future little you.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Couples are thinking creatively about 529 plans. Some of our clients let us know that they plan to list a 529 account as part of their wedding or baby shower registry. You can open a Wealthfront 529 with just $500, which will definitely go further than adding that fine china to the list. Trust me, I have two sets from my wedding, which I think I\u2019ve used <i>maybe<\/i> once. Surprisingly, we\u2019ve seen many single clients without children choose to open a small 529 account as well. They have enough foresight to know that financial planning will be the last thing they will want to think about when they are pregnant and preparing to welcome a new life into the world. They know that they can change the beneficiary of the 529 account to any relative at any time and their future selves could not be more grateful. The baby blankets, onesies, lovies and Sophie the Giraffes my wife and I received for our twin girls were adorable, but I wish someone forced me to open a 529 account eight years ago. Every penny counts!<\/p>\n<p><i>Give your niece or nephew a gift that doesn\u2019t break.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>As an uncle, I frequently ask myself if my niece and nephews <i>really<\/i> need another $40 toy that will break when their parents step on it in the middle of the night. We have some clients who are choosing to open their niece or nephew a 529 account. Although it sounds boring in the near term, they will absolutely be the cool Aunt or Uncle once it comes time to pay for college.<\/p>\n<p><i>Grandparents can help their kids, grandkids and themselves<\/i><\/p>\n<p>While our clients tend to be younger, we have heard from a few grandparents who are taking advantage of being able to superfund a 529 account for their grandchildren. The 529 supports a unique feature which allows you to pre-fund up to five years of contributions gift tax-free, aka \u201csuperfunding.\u201d So, instead of the $14,000 per year annual gift tax exclusion limit, each grandparent could pre-fund up to $70,000 (5 x $14,000). Together, that means grandparents could open a 529 plan with $140,000, per beneficiary. We built this feature into our product to make it seamless to enjoying the benefit of gifting today, tax-free. For wealthy grandparents looking for a creative way to save on taxes, $140,000 per grandchild can create a nice shelter. I already asked both grandparents of my girls to contribute to my girls\u2019 529 accounts for my birthday, their birthdays and every holiday in between.<\/p>\n<p><b>Keep Yourself from Raiding Your Savings<\/b><\/p>\n<p>By now, we all understand that a 529 plan allows us to grow savings tax-free, for a very singular purpose &#8212; to pay for future college expenses. What I love most about a 529 plan is that my recurring monthly deposit forces me to put money away for my girls\u2019 future college bills, instead of pretending to save using a savings account that I\u2019m tempted to raid every now and then. If I do raid my 529 account for expenses other than my girls\u2019 qualified higher education expenses, the earnings are subject to federal and state income taxes and an additional 10% federal penalty tax. This singularity of purpose <i>and<\/i> tax penalty provides me with a good incentive to <i>not raid the 529 cookie jar<\/i>. So do your future self a favor, and open a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/529\">Wealthfront 529 College Savings Plan<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\"><strong>Disclosure<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\">For more information about the Wealthfront 529 College Savings Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), download the Plan Description and Participation Agreement (to be made available on Plan launch) or request one by calling or emailing support@wealthfront.com or (650) 249-4250.
