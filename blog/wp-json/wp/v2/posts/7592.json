You watch as she opens it with nervous anticipation, second only to yours. Years of hard work &#8212; the studying, the extracurriculars, the campus tours &#8212; all come down to this moment&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Accepted!<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve been imagining the day your child gets into their dream college for a long time. Seeing them achieve this milestone will no doubt give you tremendous joy. But being able to provide them the financial support they\u2019ll need will make the moment even more joyful. But with the cost of college rising much faster than inflation, how will you be ready? Simple: by starting early.<\/p>\n<p>And Wealthfront wants to help.<\/p>\n<p>Today we\u2019re thrilled to announce college planning with Path. Sound familiar? It should. Earlier this year we launched Path &#8212; the most comprehensive automated financial planning and investing solution &#8212; to help you build towards retirement. And now we\u2019re making Path even better by adding college planning to help you prepare for your child\u2019s academic future.<\/p>\n<p>Path walks you through every important aspect of college planning and delivers a complete, personalized assessment that helps you start preparing for that important moment in your child\u2019s life. And because our team of PhDs has thought through the complex calculations on the back end, you can do it with just a few taps on your phone. We make it easy!<\/p>\n<p>First, Path projects the future costs of college. You select any college you like, and we\u2019ll determine the total costs with a detailed breakdown of what you\u2019ll be accountable for &#8212; things like tuition, room and board, and books. State school? Ivy League? Path helps you weigh all the options. And don\u2019t worry, you can change the school you\u2019re building towards at any time and the data will automatically update for you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/blog_collegelaunch_schoolselection.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"595\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Next, we calculate your expected financial aid. We use information we already know about you through Path, like your income, finances, and how many children you have. We also pull in outside data to specify\u00a0the costs of a particular college and how they calculate financial aid. This provides a customized estimate per school that you won\u2019t find anywhere else.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/blog_collegelaunch_financialaid2.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, a special touch: you get to add a photo of the apple of your eye! Consider this our way of letting you\u00a0put one of the 500 pictures of your kids you have stored on your phone to good use.<\/p>\n<p>The final step is the most important one: you get to grow those savings! Path helps you build a savings plan to help close the gap. You\u2019ll choose how much you can save, and Path shows you how far that will go towards covering college expenses. And just like with retirement, you can see the impact when you\u2019re able to save more.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/blog_collegelaunch_goalcard.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of savings, let\u2019s talk about the key to all of this: <strong>the 529<\/strong>. The 529 is an investment account specifically designed for college savings, and you\u2019ll need to open one with Wealthfront to enable the college planning service within Path. For those with external 529 accounts, stay tuned: you&#8217;ll soon be able to link your existing 529s\u00a0and unlock Path&#8217;s\u00a0powerful new feature.<\/p>\n<p>Just like a retirement account, a 529 has tax advantages that help your savings grow faster. As a result, your returns can be as much as <strong>16% higher<\/strong> than in a traditional investment account. And what\u2019s even better? Withdrawals from a 529 account are <em>tax-free<\/em>, so long as you use the money to pay for tuition, books and any other education-related expenses.<\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront is the only advisor who can deliver the most cost-effective 529 and a personalized college planning service all in one. We know the the path to getting into college is hard enough, so we want to ensure the path to saving for it is easy.<\/p>\n<p>So dream big for your kids. We\u2019ve got your back.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today we\u2019re thrilled to announce college planning with Path. Sound familiar? It should.
