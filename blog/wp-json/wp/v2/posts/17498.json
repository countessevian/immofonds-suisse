And no matter whether it\u2019s Sunday, Monday, Labor Day, or some other special day, your funds will arrive within minutes. You can track your transfer\u2019s progress in real time in the Wealthfront app.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do free instant withdrawals work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These faster withdrawals are made possible by new standards in the financial industry called the RTP\u00ae Network and FedNow Service that allow your money to move much more quickly between institutions. Wealthfront has now adopted FedNow in addition to RTP, which we adopted earlier this year, and we\u2019ve already moved over $8 billion of clients\u2019 money using these new standards. <strong>It\u2019s never been faster to move money from your Cash Account to an eligible external account, including those at Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, and Wells Fargo. <\/strong>Accounts held at over 1,000 institutions are automatically <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/21187117774996-Which-banks-are-RTP-enabled\">eligible<\/a> and we expect that number will continue to <a href=\"https:\/\/explore.fednow.org\/explore-the-city?id=3&amp;postId=69&amp;postTitle=fednow-service-achieves-new-participation-milestone:-1,000-plus-financial-institutions\">grow rapidly<\/a>. You can see the full list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theclearinghouse.org\/payment-systems\/rtp\/rtp-participating-financial-institutions\">RTP-eligible banks here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.frbservices.org\/financial-services\/fednow\/organizations\">FedNow-eligible banks here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve linked an eligible account, you can initiate a free, instant withdrawal any day, anytime, and you\u2019ll receive the funds within minutes. To make sure your eligible accounts are linked and ready for instant withdrawals, click \u201c+ Add account\u201d at the bottom of your Wealthfront dashboard, and then select \u201cExternal\u201d from the account options.<strong> <\/strong>To initiate a withdrawal, head to the \u201ctransfers\u201d menu on our website or app and select \u201cWithdraw.\u201d You\u2019ll see any RTP- or FedNow-eligible accounts clearly marked with a lightning bolt, and you\u2019ll get a preview of your expected transfer timing with an arrival estimate. (Withdrawals to accounts that are not RTP- or FedNow-eligible are processed via ACH and usually arrive in 1-2 business days.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"634\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-2.52.53\u202fPM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17499\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-2.52.53\u202fPM.png 1248w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-2.52.53\u202fPM-640x325.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-2.52.53\u202fPM-1043x530.png 1043w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-2.52.53\u202fPM-768x390.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the funds have been sent, we\u2019ll send you a real-time push notification letting you know.

But maybe you\u2019re nervous about last-minute expenses because you\u2019re not sure how long it will take to transfer your money where you need it to be. As a result, you might keep some of your cash in accounts where it earns very little interest, just so it\u2019s available in a pinch. We\u2019ve worked to eliminate that stress and hassle by making it possible to easily and instantly withdraw your money from the Cash Account for free, any time of day and any day of the year. You can forget about counting business days and confidently earn a high 4.00% APY from our partner banks on all of your cash right up until the day you need it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Build long-term wealth on your own terms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we\u2019re building a financial system that favors people, not institutions. That means we\u2019re constantly working to improve the tools we offer for managing and growing your money, including our high-interest Cash Account. You may have learned to expect slow and expensive money movement from your other accounts, but you can count on us to keep making our products better. Stay tuned for even more improvements to the Cash Account next year.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve been working all year to make it easier, faster, and cheaper to access your money when you need it.
