We\u2019re proud to offer our ETF-level Tax-Loss Harvesting to clients with just $500 and at no extra cost, and we\u2019re delighted to have offered this important and powerful service for ten years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront\u2019s Tax-Loss Harvesting involves selling an ETF which has declined in value and replacing it with a highly correlated but not identical ETF to maintain the overall risk and return characteristics of your portfolio. The losses can then be used to offset any taxable gains you may have that year (and, if you have losses left over, up to $3,000 of ordinary income), resulting in a lower tax bill. While the individual losses themselves can be small, the cumulative effect on your tax bill can be potentially quite large. The total estimated benefit for all of our clients is staggering, and we think that\u2019s worth celebrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the years since Wealthfront launched Tax-Loss Harvesting, our software has harvested nearly $3.2 billion in losses to help clients lower their taxes at no extra cost ($1.5 billion of which was harvested in 2022 and $2.8 billion of which was over the last five years). Assuming a 37.5% marginal tax rate, the losses harvested by Wealthfront over the last decade could be worth an estimated $1.19 billion in tax savings to Wealthfront clients \u2013\u2013 not even taking into account the potential for those savings to be reinvested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"12430\" height=\"7488\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/TLH_Blog_Anniversary_Graph-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16447\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A powerful tax-minimization strategy in all market conditions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront\u2019s Tax-Loss Harvesting is a powerful tool in a broad range of market conditions. You might assume it would only be valuable in a year when the market is down, but this isn\u2019t true. While Tax-Loss Harvesting is very useful in market conditions with a high degree of volatility (like what we\u2019ve seen in 2022 and so far in 2023), the service can even harvest losses and generate potential tax savings in a year when the market is up overall. Software is uniquely suited to maximize the benefits of Tax-Loss Harvesting. By monitoring portfolios on a daily basis, Wealthfront can take advantage of temporary dips in the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is unlikely an individual investor will consistently outperform the broader market on a pre-tax basis, tax-loss harvesting presents an opportunity to outperform on an after-tax basis. <strong>In fact, tax-loss harvesting represents what we consider to be the only reliable way to get excess after-tax returns.<\/strong> This is because losses generated from selling positions that have declined in value can offset any gains realized in the other parts of the portfolio. Net tax losses up to $3,000 can also be deducted from ordinary income and the investor can carry additional losses forward to future years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax-loss harvesting is a tax deferral strategy, but that\u2019s not the only way it can save you money. The tax savings generated can also be reinvested and compounded over time, allowing you to take advantage of the time value of money. As a result, you are better off paying taxes later rather than sooner. In addition, the long-term capital gain tax rate you pay on your decreased basis will be lower than the tax rate from which you benefited from harvesting a short-term capital loss. Moreover, if the portfolio is held for a future bequest to one\u2019s heirs or is used for a charitable contribution, the tax implications can potentially be minimized or even avoided entirely in some cases under current tax laws.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Direct indexing: A more advanced form of Tax-Loss Harvesting<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Wealthfront also introduced a more advanced product featuring Tax-Loss Harvesting known as US Direct Indexing, and updated the service to its current form in 2015. US Direct Indexing is available to clients with $100,000 or more in a taxable Automated Investing Account at Wealthfront, and can offer even greater tax savings. This product takes advantage of the volatility of the individual stocks that make up the US stocks portion of client portfolios. Since 2015, US Direct Indexing has generated an estimated annual after-tax benefit worth an additional 0.53% of the US stocks portion of clients\u2019 portfolios compared to ETF-level Tax-Loss Harvesting over the same period, assuming a 37.5% marginal tax rate. US Direct Indexing can help lower your tax bill even more than our ETF-level Tax-Loss Harvesting service because even during periods when the overall stock market rises, there are always some stocks and sectors that decline, even if only temporarily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s illustrate this technique with an example, using the CRSP Total US Market index as a market proxy. We can replicate the behavior of the CRSP index by holding a sample of the stocks in the index. These stocks are chosen to replicate the industry and size composition of the index while minimizing tracking error between the sample and the overall index. Now suppose large pharmaceutical stocks have declined in value. You might sell Merck to realize a loss and buy Pfizer to enable you to continue to track the index. Or if the autos declined you could sell Ford and buy General Motors. Automating the process, one can continuously look for losses to harvest, potentially adding a meaningful amount to the annual after-tax return of the investor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Wealthfront\u2019s Tax-Loss Harvesting, US Direct Indexing is available at no additional cost. To learn more about our US Direct Indexing product, please see our <a href=\"https:\/\/research.wealthfront.com\/whitepapers\/stock-level-tax-loss-harvesting\/\">white paper<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Build long-term wealth on your own terms<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we believe that investors should focus on what they can control: fees, risk, and taxes. It was this belief that led us to build our Tax-Loss Harvesting and US Direct Indexing, both of which are designed to help clients to improve their after-tax returns at no additional cost. We\u2019re proud to have been among the first automated investment services to introduce tax-loss harvesting so Wealthfront clients can keep more of what they earn with no extra effort. We\u2019ve long said that tax-loss harvesting is the most valuable reason to choose a robo-advisor, and after a decade, we think the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/tax-loss-harvesting-2022-results\/\">results<\/a> of our service speak for themselves.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A decade ago, Wealthfront revolutionized the investing space by being among the first automated investment services to offer Tax-Loss Harvesting to clients.
