This post has been updated to reflect this change.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we help you build long-term wealth on your own terms. Our investment in technology allows us to build and ship new products and enhancements quickly, which means our offerings get better every year. This was especially true in 2024\u2014we launched a new product or feature almost every month of the year, all designed to deliver more value to you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Automate wealth-building tools and offer them at a lower cost so more people can access them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Build products that can benefit you in all market conditions.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make money work the way it should, with no hassle or headaches.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These principles informed everything we built last year, both big and small. Here\u2019s what we launched in 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Faster, easier money movement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Free instant withdrawals:<\/strong> It\u2019s now faster than ever to access the money in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/cash\">Cash Account<\/a> (with an industry-leading APY from our partner banks). In early 2024, we began offering free same-day withdrawals to any eligible linked external account. We then upgraded to 24\/7\/365 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/free-instant-withdrawals\/#:~:text=Once%20you've%20linked%20an,receive%20the%20funds%20within%20minutes.\">free instant withdrawals<\/a> for eligible accounts through the RTP Network and FedNow\u2014including weekends and holidays. Nearly every platform that offers instant withdrawals charges a fee for it, but not us. This feature is so popular that clients have already transferred more than $8 billion through our faster withdrawals. We\u2019ve loved hearing your positive feedback.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Streamlined transfers &amp; recurring withdrawals: <\/strong>We made it easier to transfer funds between individual, joint, and trust Cash Accounts you own. You can also set up recurring withdrawals from Wealthfront, which we\u2019ve seen many of you use to automatically send money to other accounts for recurring payments like a mortgage or credit card bill.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sophisticated tax optimization strategies made simple<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Automated Bond Ladder: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/bond-ladders\/\">Bond ladders<\/a> provide steady yield, help manage interest rate risk, and help investors save on state income taxes, but they\u2019ve traditionally been complex to set up\u2014often requiring manual tracking or high management fees. To make this smart wealth-building strategy more accessible, we launched our Automated Bond Ladder\u2014a first-of-its-kind product that automates the entire process for you for a low, annual 0.15% advisory fee.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wealthfront\u2019s S&amp;P 500 Direct: <\/strong>We reimagined how investors can benefit from investing in the S&amp;P 500\u00ae index. With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/sp500-direct\">S&amp;P 500 Direct<\/a>, you can hold many of the individual stocks that make up the index and benefit from our automatic Tax-Loss Harvesting. This new product has been particularly popular with public company employees who want to offset capital gains from equity compensation.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tax-optimized portfolio allocations: <\/strong>We <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/2024-asset-allocation\/\">updated the asset allocations<\/a> for all of our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/investing\">Automated Index Investing Accounts<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/automated-bond-portfolio\">Automated Bond Portfolios<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/retirement\">IRAs<\/a> to help improve your after-tax, risk-adjusted returns. For our taxable Automated Investing Accounts, we now offer three portfolio versions tailored to low, medium, and high tax levels. For California residents, we\u2019ve introduced a California-specific version of our taxable portfolios which includes a California municipal bond ETF. The interest from this ETF is exempt from both state and federal taxes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lower costs &amp; more savings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Free wires from any Cash Account: <\/strong>We made <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/you-can-now-send-wire-transfers\/\">wire transfers free<\/a> for all Cash Accounts as part of our ongoing effort to lower your costs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More free ATMs<\/strong>: In addition to our nationwide network of over 19,000 free ATMs, you can now benefit from free out-of-network ATM withdrawals, too. We reimburse ATM fees up to $7.50 per withdrawal, twice per month, for withdrawals from any ATM in the US.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lower APR on our Portfolio Line of Credit<\/strong>: We simplified and reduced the APR on our Portfolio Line of Credit\u2014now, instead of a range, you see one flat rate. We decreased that rate by more than 1% in 2024. As of the publication date of this article, the APR is a very low 5.41%, making it an attractive option compared to credit cards (average APR: 19.49%) and personal loans (APR: 6.99% \u2013 35.99%).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Improved client experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Automated account closure:<\/strong> Closing an account should be as easy as opening one. Now, in the event you want to close your Cash Account, you can now initiate a closure when you do a full withdrawal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shared views<\/strong>: If you have a joint account, you and your partner now have a better view of your combined financial picture. You can both now access shared accounts through a unique login, see who made each transaction, and allow your partner to see any of your individual accounts so it&#8217;s easier to tell what&#8217;s just yours and what&#8217;s shared. We&#8217;re also working on adding joint checking features soon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s ahead in 2025<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2024 was a big year, and we\u2019re honored that over 1 million clients like you now trust us with more than $80 billion of your hard-earned savings. And we\u2019re just getting started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, our products are constantly getting better, and 2025 will be no different. This year, we\u2019re excited to improve how our ecosystem of products works together to provide you with a more seamless experience as you build long-term wealth. We\u2019ll also work on new ways to support your journey to reach important financial milestones.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Note: As of June 1, 2025, we have lowered the annual advisory fee for our Automated Bond Ladder to 0.15%.
