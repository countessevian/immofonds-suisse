We also put clients\u2019 interests first in everything we do. This has been true since our founding, and we\u2019re proud of how we\u2019ve helped many clients achieve financial success. As we look to our next phase of product-led expansion and impact, we\u2019re excited to announce that accomplished legal executive Michelle Wilson is joining our Board of Directors.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A highly experienced advisor<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle brings more than 25 years of experience advising dynamic startups, including Okta, Pinterest, Stripe, and Zendesk. Michelle also spent 13 years as Amazon\u2019s General Counsel guiding strategic decisions across the company\u2019s retail, cloud computing, content, and hardware businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She is passionate about Wealthfront\u2019s focus on using software and automation to make sophisticated financial management simple. \u201cThroughout my career I\u2019ve sought out strong technical teams that build great products and solve hard problems for consumers, and that\u2019s exactly what excites me about joining Wealthfront\u2019s Board of Directors,\u201d said Michelle. \u201cI have long been impressed by Wealthfront\u2019s impact on the financial industry, and I look forward to helping this exciting company prepare for its next chapter.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle\u2019s experience rounds out our board of seasoned talent including business leader Jason Kilar, venture capitalist Mike Volpi, marketing expert Jaleh Bisharat, and experienced financial executive Ken Goldman. We look forward to benefiting from her expertise as we continue to build software-driven products that help clients improve their financial outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building for the future<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle joins Wealthfront\u2019s board following an exciting year of product-led expansion. In 2024, we expanded our product suite with two new offerings that use the power of technology to simplify complex financial strategies: We launched an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/automated-bond-ladder\">Automated Bond Ladder<\/a>, which automates the process of building a Treasury ladder, and Wealthfront\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/sp500-direct\">S&amp;P 500 Direct<\/a>, which combines the performance of the S&amp;P 500\u00ae with the benefits of tax-loss harvesting.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we look to the future, we\u2019re focused on expanding our offering to support you as you reach key life events and achieve new financial milestones. We\u2019re thrilled to have Michelle\u2019s deep startup experience on our board, and know she will have a huge impact on our vision to help you build long-term wealth on your own terms.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to our Board of Directors, Michelle!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At Wealthfront, we build tech-driven financial products that help you turn your savings into long-term wealth.
