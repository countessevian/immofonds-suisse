In more than 30 states, you can deduct at least part of your contributions from your state taxes, and no matter where you live, earnings are tax-free. Withdrawals will be, too, as long as your child uses the money for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/individuals\/qualified-ed-expenses\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">qualified higher education expenses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at any <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.savingforcollege.com\/eligible-institutions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eligible institution<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can also use 529 withdrawals for vocational school, trade school, or K-12 education up to $10,000 per year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">529 plans are also popular because they don\u2019t have annual contribution limits. There are only two \u201climits\u201d: each state has an aggregate contribution limit (these differ from state to state), and\u00a0 if you contribute more than $19,000 in a year, you\u2019ll have to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/forms-pubs\/about-form-709-united-states-gift-and-generation-skipping-transfer-tax-return\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report it as a gift on your taxes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It will then count toward your lifetime gift tax exclusion limit (which you likely won\u2019t have to worry about unless you plan to give away more than $13.99 million in your lifetime). If you have questions about this, it\u2019s wise to consult a tax professional about your specific situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is, however, an exception to the $19,000 rule \u2014 and it could serve as a powerful tool in preparing for your child\u2019s college expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s a bird, it\u2019s a plane\u2026 it\u2019s superfunding<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike retirement savings, which have decades to compound and grow, you\u2019ve usually only got around 18 years before you\u2019ll need to pay for the beneficiary\u2019s education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help compensate for this, the IRS offers a workaround: You can fund a 529 with up to five years of contributions at once \u2014 up to $95,000 per parent, for a total of $190,000 \u2014 without it counting toward your lifetime gift tax exclusion limit. This feature, called superfunding, dramatically increases how much money you can use to jumpstart a 529 by using the power of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/what-is-compounding\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">compounding<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to your advantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obviously, that\u2019s a ton of money to allocate to a savings plan \u2014 but if it\u2019s financially possible for you, the benefits can be pretty incredible. (That\u2019s why we designed the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/college\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wealthfront 529<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with superfunding as a standard option.) <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/investor-resources-education\/news\/lump-sum-investing-versus-cost-averaging-which-is-better\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research from Vanguard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> suggests that if you\u2019re deciding between investing a lump sum today or dollar cost averaging it into the market (where you invest a portion of the total sum on a regular schedule), lump-sum investing tends to yield a higher ending balance on average.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Superfunding could also make your future self behave<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When saving to send a child to college, you might want to consider taking advantage of \u201ccommitment devices\u201d that lock you into a good course of action today \u2014 and prevent you from making poor choices tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can afford it, superfunding can act as a commitment device. That\u2019s because it requires making one large deposit, and thereby avoiding the decision fatigue \u2014 and potential disillusionment \u2014 you might face with an 18-year saving program. (Especially important during those teenage years, when your kids are giving you attitude for days!)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>More (super) food for thought<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before superfunding a 529 plan, here are a few more things you should consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Liquidity:<\/strong> Can you really afford to take up to $190,000 and lock it away in a tax-deferred account for 18 years? You\u2019ll face stiff penalties if you withdraw money for non-college expenses.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Commitment<\/strong>: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How confident are you that the money will be used for your child\u2019s education? What happens if they win a full-ride scholarship or decide to take a different path? Though 529 plans allow you to switch beneficiaries to relatives like siblings or cousins, it\u2019s a question worth considering.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Plan selection<\/strong>: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some 529 plans have few fund choices and high fees. So, if you\u2019re going to superfund, make sure it\u2019s into a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/college\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">low-cost plan with high-quality investments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s worth noting that thanks to the SECURE 2.0 Act, which went into effect in 2024, it\u2019s now <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.savingforcollege.com\/article\/roll-over-529-plan-funds-to-a-roth-ira\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">possible to roll over<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> up to $35,000 of unused funds from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA in the beneficiary\u2019s name. The 529 plan must have been established for the beneficiary at least 15 years before the rollover, and earnings and contributions from the last five years aren\u2019t eligible.\u00a0 The rollover amount for any given year is limited to the annual contribution limit for Roth IRAs, which is $7,000 in 2025 or $8,000 for those 50 and older.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Use windfalls to superfund<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Windfalls are large, one-time financial gains; they could occur when your employer goes public, for example, or when a relative leaves you an inheritance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve received a windfall, superfunding a 529 plan might be a good way to use it. Not only will it create a healthy college fund for your child, it could bring you peace of mind as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what we mean: How would it feel to know you\u2019ve made a significant contribution to your child\u2019s future education \u2014 without the need for ongoing savings and maintenance? Probably pretty good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why, if you have the resources, superfunding a 529 is a smart strategy for reaching your college savings goals.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This post was updated in February 2025 to reflect current contribution limits.
