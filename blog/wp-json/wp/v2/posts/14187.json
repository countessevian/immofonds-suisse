That\u2019s why earlier this year, we made it possible to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/you-can-now-use-wealthfront-to-build-and-automate-your-own-portfolio\/\">customize your Wealthfront portfolio<\/a>. <strong>And it\u2019s why today, we\u2019re expanding our menu of investments even more to include hundreds of options, including two cryptocurrency trusts: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront is the first investing service that makes it possible to gain exposure to cryptocurrency as part of a diversified portfolio with automation features like tax-sensitive rebalancing, intelligent dividend reinvestment, and our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/tax-loss-harvesting-101\/\">Tax-Loss Harvesting<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get cryptocurrency exposure without the hassle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying cryptocurrency can feel intimidating \u2014 it takes time and effort to research all of the options, set up a wallet, and monitor an additional account. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve made it easy to get exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum right in your Wealthfront portfolio, no wallets required. Instead of buying coins yourself, you can invest in <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GBTC\/\">GBTC <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/ETHE\/\">ETHE<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can add GBTC and\/or ETHE to your portfolio by following the instructions <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360059631751-Customizing-your-portfolio\">here<\/a> and selecting a combined allocation of up to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/4403721436948\">10% of your total portfolio<\/a>. We limit your allocation to GBTC and ETHE because, as a fiduciary, we act in your best interests at all times, and these investments can be riskier and more volatile than most ETFs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GBTC and ETHE round out our significantly <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/4404335475220-Investments-Available-at-Wealthfront-\">expanded menu of investment options<\/a>. For example, you can now choose from a bigger selection of ARK ETFs, pick ETFs that are specific to industries like cannabis or self-driving cars, or choose from a larger pool of socially responsible investments. The choice is yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your ideal portfolio, automated<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront\u2019s automation takes the chore out of managing your portfolio and works to maximize your after-tax returns at no extra cost. Whether you build a highly personalized portfolio, stick with our expert-built recommended portfolios, or bring over investments from another firm, we\u2019ll handle the details. That means we\u2019ll make the trades and rebalance your investments so your allocation doesn\u2019t drift too far over time. We\u2019ll also help you keep more of what you earn with our industry-leading Tax-Loss Harvesting service, which takes advantage of market volatility to lower your taxes whenever there\u2019s a suitable alternative available. Tax-Loss Harvesting alone typically generates enough tax savings to more than cover our advisory fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these new cryptocurrency investment options and our dramatically expanded menu of ETFs (most of which are eligible for Tax-Loss Harvesting), it\u2019s now easier than ever to make Wealthfront the home base for all of your investments.&nbsp; And soon, you\u2019ll have even more choices when you invest at Wealthfront. In the near future, we\u2019ll offer specially curated portfolios for clients interested in socially responsible investing. Wealthfront is the one platform you need to build a secure and rewarding financial future, and it will just keep getting better.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Note: As of March 21, 2024, Wealthfront uses the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to represent the Bitcoin asset class instead of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
