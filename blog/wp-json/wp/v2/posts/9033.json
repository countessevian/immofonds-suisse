Warm snuggles. First smiles. A new baby brings so much joy into your life.<\/p>\n<p>And with that joy comes focus \u2014 on trying to do everything right, on trying to give everything to your child.<\/p>\n<p>One of the things you should be thinking about? <a href=\"https:\/\/529.wealthfront.com\/college-savings-basics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paying for college<\/a>. By the time today\u2019s newborns leave the nest, the average cost of a four-year private education could be $302,700, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"#methodology\">Wealthfront research<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Although that number is undoubtedly daunting \u2014 and that future seems unfathomably far away \u2014 starting early will give your money time to grow. That&#8217;s where a 529 plan comes in. Here are four steps to take right now.<\/p>\n<h2>Calculate how much you hope to save<\/h2>\n<p>Though most parents save for college by diligently socking away money each month, we\u2019d encourage you to start with a lump sum. Why? Because it\u2019ll give your investment the most time to compound:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To pay for your child to attend Stanford, you could either save $1,663 per month, over 18 years, for a total of $359,208. Or you could deposit $239,059 today \u2014 and let it grow.<\/li>\n<li>To pay for your child to attend UCLA, you could either save $720 over 18 years, for a total of $155,520. Or you could deposit $103,439 today \u2014 and let it grow over the next 18 years.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s a chart that shows the difference:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9039 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SavingforCollege_Visuals-01-compressor-946x530.png\" alt=\"Saving for College: Lump Sum vs Monthly Sum\" width=\"946\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SavingforCollege_Visuals-01-compressor-946x530.png 946w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SavingforCollege_Visuals-01-compressor-640x359.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SavingforCollege_Visuals-01-compressor-768x430.png 768w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SavingforCollege_Visuals-01-compressor-1536x860.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SavingforCollege_Visuals-01-compressor-2048x1147.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px\" \/><br \/>\nNote: The future amount required is calculated by taking this year\u2019s tuition, fees, room &amp; board and applying 4% annual inflation (higher education inflation on average is approximately 2% higher than the average increase in the Consumer Price Index). The lump sum required now is the amount needed to invest this year assuming 4.7% investment returns, which is the average net-of-fee annual expected return for Wealthfront 529 risk score 9.0 investment plan, to meet the future amount required at matriculation. This compares to the monthly savings required if you can\u2019t invest via lump sum and instead contribute the same amount every month to meet the goal.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, six figures of cash is tough to come by, and won\u2019t be a feasible option for many parents. But the point isn\u2019t how much you put in; the point is it\u2019s incredibly valuable to start with whatever lump sum you can afford.<\/p>\n<p>To make your own calculations, log into Wealthfront and use our automated financial planning to estimate the future costs of a particular college, predict financial aid, and create realistic savings goals.<\/p>\n<h2>Open up a 529 account<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of their tax benefits and relative flexibility, many experts consider <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/529.wealthfront.com\/what-is-529\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">529 plans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one of the best ways to save for college.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>You\u2019ll receive tax advantages<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Your money grows tax-free. Withdrawals are also tax-free, as long as they\u2019re used toward tuition, fees, books, room and board, computers, etc.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>You\u2019ll remain the boss<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As a parent, you can maintain ownership of the 529 plan, and make your child the beneficiary. This has two benefits: You\u2019ll have complete control over when and how the money is withdrawn, and when it comes to applying for financial aid, your child won\u2019t have a huge account in their name. (Keep in mind: You can always change the beneficiary in the future if you have more than one kid.)<\/p>\n<h3><strong>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/saving-for-college-superfunding-529-account\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">superfund the 529<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You can make a large, tax-advantaged lump sum investment, which is known as \u201csuperfunding.\u201d You and your spouse can each invest five times the annual gift tax limit of $15,000 (for a total of $150,000 per child, per couple) \u2014 which would allow ample time for compounding, and give you a significant head start on your college savings goals.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>You can use it for K-12, too<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Under the new tax law, you can now withdraw up to $10,000 per year, tax- and penalty-free, to use for private school tuition. Not all states have gotten on board yet, so check your specific 529 plan before going this route.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest downside of 529s? They\u2019re not flexible. If your child decides to skip college, or gets a full-ride scholarship, you could transfer the account to a sibling or cousin. But if you end up using the money for non-education expenses, you\u2019ll owe taxes on the earnings, plus a 10% penalty.<\/p>\n<p>There are other options to consider outside of 529 accounts \u2014 you can also save for college with a Coverdell Education Savings Account or Custodial Account. Below, we cover the basics of each:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Can be used for qualified education expenses<\/li>\n<li>Money accumulates tax-free<\/li>\n<li>Have extremely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/taxtopics\/tc310\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">low contribution limits<\/a> ($2,000 per year)<\/li>\n<li>Phase out your ability to contribute after your income hits $95,000 per year (or $190,000 for married couples)<\/li>\n<li>If money isn\u2019t used for educational expenses, earnings are subject to tax and a penalty<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Custodial Accounts (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act \/ Uniform Transfers to Minors Act)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Can use accounts for any purpose \u2014 not just education expenses<\/li>\n<li>Money does <em>not<\/em> accumulate tax-free<\/li>\n<li>Child gains complete control after they become an adult (usually at age 18)<\/li>\n<li>Are considered your child\u2019s asset, which can lower their financial aid award<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Choose the best 529 plan for you<\/h2>\n<p>If you couldn\u2019t tell already, we think <a href=\"https:\/\/529.wealthfront.com\/benefits-529-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">529 plans are an ideal way to save for college<\/a>. When it comes to picking a particular 529 plan, you have a lot of options. Each state, plus the District of Columbia, administers its own plans, and you can choose whichever one appeals to you.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While your home state should be a consideration, you don\u2019t have to choose the state you live in, or the state in which you think your child will attend college. If you live in California, for example, you could enroll in Nevada\u2019s plan, and then eventually use the money to send your child to school in New York. For helpful breakdowns of each state\u2019s 529 plan, visit <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.savingforcollege.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saving for College<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The only exception is if you choose a \u201cprepaid tuition plan,\u201d which lets you lock in today\u2019s tuition at public schools in your state. Since these aren\u2019t very flexible, however, we generally don\u2019t suggest using them. By choosing a regular 529 plan, your child can use the money for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/individuals\/qualified-ed-expenses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Qualified Higher Education Expenses<\/a> at any <a href=\"https:\/\/fafsa.ed.gov\/FAFSA\/app\/schoolSearch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eligible institution<\/a> \u2014 no matter which state sponsored the plan.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to reading reviews and analyzing investment options, you should also consider these factors when selecting your plan:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>State income tax deductions<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>More than 30 states offer residents state income tax deductions for contributing to their specific 529 plans. Seven states offer a deduction for contributing to any plan \u2014 even if it\u2019s administered by a different state. For a full list of state tax policies, read the <a href=\"https:\/\/research.wealthfront.com\/whitepapers\/college-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wealthfront 529 White Paper<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fees<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Management and administrative fees vary greatly depending on the plan. Advisor-sold plans, which usually come with personalized financial advice and active management, are pricier than direct-sold plans, which tend to feature low-cost funds.<\/p>\n<h2>Pick investments for your 529<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re almost there! Once you\u2019ve decided which 529 plan to use, you\u2019ll also need to decide how to invest the money within it.<\/p>\n<p>While a broker or advisor may try to steer you into actively managed mutual funds, we wouldn\u2019t suggest using them. Advisors may make gleaming promises of \u201cbeating the market,\u201d but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iijournals.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.3905\/jpm.2000.319766\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research shows<\/a> that, when fees are taken into account, actively managed funds actually fare worse than index funds.<\/p>\n<p>So, as always, we advise looking for index funds and other low-cost, passively managed investments.<\/p>\n<p>Within many 529s, you\u2019ll find age-based options that, like target-date retirement funds, automatically adjust their asset allocation as your child gets closer to college. Though this trajectory, known as a <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/213257646-How-did-Wealthfront-recommend-my-529-investment-plan-and-glide-path-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">glide path<\/a>, would ideally take your risk tolerance into account, many direct-sold plans don\u2019t personalize their recommendations.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many direct-sold plans also only offer between one and five different asset classes \u2014 and according to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/research.wealthfront.com\/whitepapers\/investment-methodology\/#7-how_many_asset_classes\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">our research<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that\u2019s no good. Additional asset classes can help your returns in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>No matter which strategy and which 529 you choose, we hope you\u2019ll start saving today.
