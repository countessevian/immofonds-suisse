As part of that commitment, we are always looking for opportunities to help you earn more and keep more. Today, we\u2019re excited to announce we\u2019re releasing updated asset allocations for all of our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/investing\">Automated Index Investing Accounts<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/automated-bond-portfolio\">Automated Bond Portfolios<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/retirement\">IRAs<\/a>. <strong>The updated portfolios are designed to further improve your risk-adjusted returns and, for all taxable accounts, improve your after-tax returns.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a closer look at what\u2019s changing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Better tax optimization to improve your after-tax returns<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve long said that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/what-are-robo-advisors-and-how-do-they-differ\/\">what sets Wealthfront apart from other robo-advisors<\/a> is our focus on after-tax returns. Many robo-advisors use Modern Portfolio Theory, a Nobel Prize-winning theory, to build a portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance, meaning pre-tax returns are likely to be fairly similar regardless of which service you choose. But few, if any, offer the degree of automated tax minimization that Wealthfront does\u2014and now, we\u2019re offering portfolios that are tailored to your tax level in addition to your risk level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a taxable Automated Investing Account (whether it\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/explore\/portfolios\/core\/classic\">Classic portfolio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/explore\/portfolios\/sri\/socially-responsible\">Socially Responsible portfolio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/211005023-Wealthfront-s-US-Direct-Indexing\">Direct Indexing portfolio<\/a>) or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/automated-bond-portfolio\">Automated Bond Portfolio<\/a>, we\u2019ll now offer three different versions tailored for clients with low, medium, and high tax levels. Using information you provide for your profile, we estimate your state and federal tax rates to offer you a personalized portfolio recommendation.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new portfolios include optimized amounts of municipal bond ETFs (in addition to other asset classes) based on your estimated tax rates. Interest from municipal bond ETFs is generally exempt from federal income tax, which can be especially advantageous for investors in higher tax brackets. For investors with lower estimated tax rates, we\u2019ll include fewer municipal bond ETFs and more corporate bond ETFs (which have a higher expected pre-tax return) because the tax savings from municipal bonds are not as valuable at lower tax rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New portfolios for California residents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you live in California, we probably don\u2019t have to tell you that the Golden State has the highest state income tax rate in the country. In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/taxes\/california-state-tax\">2024<\/a>, the highest marginal California tax rate is 13.3%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re excited to offer California-specific versions of all of our taxable Automated Investing Accounts, which will now include a California municipal bond ETF. The interest earned from this ETF is exempt from both state and federal income tax. This means you can now get a California-specific version of any taxable Automated Investing Account at any risk score, optimized to your tax level. Investing in California municipal bond ETFs can help investors with low, medium, and high tax brackets keep significantly more of what they earn\u2014especially those in the highest tax brackets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When our Investment Research team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/how-should-i-evaluate-an-etf\/\">evaluates ETFs<\/a> for Wealthfront\u2019s platform, we consider important factors like expense ratio, liquidity, and tax exposure. With these things in mind, we\u2019ve identified a pair of California municipal bond ETFs that meet our criteria, and allow us to help our California-resident clients further improve their after-tax returns.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Improved risk-adjusted returns for all Automated Investing Accounts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re making additional updates to the asset allocations for all Automated Index Investing Accounts, including Wealthfront IRAs and Automated Bond Portfolios, to improve your expected risk-adjusted returns. These updates factor in market performance over the last several years, and affect both taxable and retirement accounts. You can read about these changes in much more detail in our <a href=\"https:\/\/research.wealthfront.com\/whitepapers\/investment-methodology\/\">Classic Portfolio Methodology white paper<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/research.wealthfront.com\/whitepapers\/socially-responsible-portfolios\/\">Socially Responsible Investing white paper<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/research.wealthfront.com\/whitepapers\/automated-bond-portfolio\/\">Automated Bond Portfolio white paper<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to benefit from these changes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve made it easy to evaluate these new portfolios in the context of your personal situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>If you already have an Automated Investing Account<\/strong>: We\u2019ll help you determine whether or not you\u2019re likely to benefit from updating to the new asset allocation. Open the Wealthfront app and go to the account dashboard for any eligible accounts, and answer a few questions about your investing timeline and tax situation. From there, we\u2019ll help you weigh the potential tax cost of making these changes against the long-term benefits of having the updated portfolios, and we\u2019ll <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360059547231-What-happens-when-you-change-the-allocation-or-risk-score-in-an-Automated-Investing-Account\">transition your portfolio tax-efficiently<\/a> if you decide to move forward.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>If you don\u2019t yet have an Automated Investing Account: <\/strong>We\u2019ll automatically recommend a portfolio for any new Automated Investing Account you open based on your estimated tax level and risk tolerance\u2014there are no additional steps for you to take.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key takeaways<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re delighted to offer these new asset allocations to help improve your after-tax, risk-adjusted returns. To recap, we now offer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Portfolios tailored to your estimated tax level (low, medium, or high)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>State-specific versions of our Classic, Socially Responsible, and Direct Indexing portfolios for California residents to further improve after-tax returns<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Additional improvements to our asset allocations, which you can read about in more detail in our <a href=\"https:\/\/research.wealthfront.com\/whitepapers\/investment-methodology\/\">Automated Investing Methodology white paper<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/research.wealthfront.com\/whitepapers\/socially-responsible-portfolios\/\">Socially Responsible Investing white paper<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/research.wealthfront.com\/whitepapers\/automated-bond-portfolio\/\">Automated Bond Portfolio white paper<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, our products are constantly getting better.
