And if you\u2019re going to do that, it\u2019s important to be familiar with the tax treatment of certain investments known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/q\/qsbs-qualified-small-business-stock.asp#:~:text=Qualified%20small%20business%20stock%20(QSBS)%20refers%20to%20shares%20of%20a,immediately%20after%20its%20stock%20issuance.\">qualified small business stock<\/a>, or QSBS. <strong>If you own QSBS, you can exclude up to $10 million of capital gains from your federal tax liability.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very attractive on its own, but many people don\u2019t realize that paying zero federal tax on $10 million could be just the beginning. We\u2019ll use a baseball analogy to demonstrate exactly how this works. If saving federal tax on $10 million is like hitting a single in baseball, what can you do with a double, a triple, or even a home run? Read on to learn more about how to take advantage of this powerful tax benefit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is QSBS?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the basics. Introduced in 1993 as Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), QSBS permits a partial exclusion on qualifying gains. The law evolved over time, but it became more exciting in September 2010 when changes were made that eliminated the federal tax on qualifying sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>QSBS has been a great opportunity for years, and people are becoming more aware of it. And while this tax-free benefit is currently available, it could potentially change if federal and state tax rates rise, or if changes are made to tax law. Many people never look beyond the basic federal benefits for QSBS and miss out on the potential estate and gift and state savings opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to qualify for QSBS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five general requirements (among many) to consider when determining whether you can qualify for QSBS tax benefits:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. In order to qualify for 100% exclusion, the stock must have been purchased from a domestic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/c-corporation.asp\">C corporation<\/a> at original issuance after September 27, 2010. (Shares you bought from another investor don\u2019t qualify.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two other levels of potential gain exclusion:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>50%, if you purchased the stock before February 18, 2009<\/li><li>75%, if you purchased the stock between February 18, 2009, and September 27, 2010<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Immediately after issuance, the corporation must have had less than $50 million of aggregate gross assets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. The stock must be in a qualified industry \u2014 the code specifically excludes certain industries including some service businesses, financial companies, energy production, farming, and hospitality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. At least 80% of the value of the corporation\u2019s assets must be used in the conduct of an active business, not an inactive business or an investment holding company. This is known as the active business requirement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. The stock must have been held for at least five years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you meet these requirements and hold qualifying shares under Section 1202, here are the potential benefits you could qualify for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"835\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-baseball-2-835x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14095\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-baseball-2-835x530.png 835w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-baseball-2-640x406.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-baseball-2-768x488.png 768w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-baseball-2-1536x975.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-baseball-2-2048x1300.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Exclude $10 million of capital gains<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To stick with the baseball theme, this step is like hitting a single. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common benefit associated with QSBS is the ability to exclude up to $10 million of capital gains or 10 times your cost basis (whichever is higher) from your federal taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sample tax savings breakdown:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1472\" height=\"314\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table1-4-1472x314.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14115\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table1-4-1472x314.png 1472w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table1-4-640x137.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table1-4-768x164.png 768w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table1-4-1536x328.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table1-4-2048x437.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1472px) 100vw, 1472px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Gift qualifying stock for a boost upon sale of the stock<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the equivalent of reaching second base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Section 1202 says that each person is entitled to their own gain exclusion for stock that they own. This opens the door for a taxpayer holding qualifying stock to gift that stock to another taxpayer so they can receive all the benefits of QSBS when they sell the stock. This is possible because the gifted shares generally carry with them the QSBS attributes as well as the same holding period and carryover cost basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, this may apply to a gift made to an individual outright (like a family member) or made to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/i\/irrevocabletrust.asp\">irrevocable<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/g\/grantor.asp#:~:text=Non%2Dgrantor%20trusts%20are%20still,tax%20entity%20from%20the%20grantor.\">non-grantor<\/a> trust for the benefit of a child or relatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sample tax savings breakdown: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1305\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table2-4-1305x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14116\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table2-4-1305x530.png 1305w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table2-4-640x260.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table2-4-768x312.png 768w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table2-4-1536x624.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table2-4-2048x832.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1305px) 100vw, 1305px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The challenge<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You must follow the rules for reporting a completed gift, valuing the shares of stock at the time of the gift and likely using up some of your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the lifetime gift and estate tax exemption is $11.7 million. So in the above example, if you gift the shares to the trust when they\u2019re valued at $10 million, you use up $10 million of your lifetime exemption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing because you\u2019ll want to use your exemption on something eventually. And you may want to use it sooner rather than later if you believe the current Congress and administration may reduce the allowable exemption. To use up less of your lifetime exemption, you can make the gift much earlier in your holding period when the share value is lower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a simplified example and these rules can become complex. It\u2019s also important to note that while Section 1202 appears to allow for this technique, the IRS has yet to comment or provide any formal guidance. You should work with your tax advisor to make sure you\u2019re executing this strategy correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. State tax-free treatment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to hit a triple with QSBS, you might consider going for tax-free treatment at the state level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several ways to do this, such as establishing your residency in a state that has one of the following criteria:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>No income tax<\/li><li>No capital gains tax<\/li><li>Conforms to the federal treatment for QSBS<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most states allow you to get tax-free treatment of QSBS, with a few exceptions\u2014most notably California, Pennsylvania, Alabama, and Mississippi. Note that Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Hawaii only partially conform to federal QSBS rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sample tax savings breakdown:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"915\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table3-5-915x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table3-5-915x530.png 915w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table3-5-640x371.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table3-5-768x445.png 768w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table3-5-1536x889.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table3-5-2048x1186.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The challenge<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to be a resident of the right state at the time of sale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, if you don\u2019t already live in a tax-free state or QSBS conforming state and aren\u2019t willing to move, this strategy isn\u2019t available to you. If you\u2019re willing to move, you can potentially save a lot on your taxes if you properly sever ties with your existing state and establish residency in your new state. There\u2019s another option, too: You might be able to establish a trust in another state\u2014and still have the trust qualify for QSBS benefits\u2014without having to move your residency to that other state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Additional tax savings with rollover method<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all this talk of base hits, what does a QSBS home run or maybe even a grand slam look like? One method is to use the provisions of IRC Section 1045 to do a QSBS rollover. Let\u2019s say that you have a large amount of QSBS and have already:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Realized the maximum $10 million tax-free gain personally<\/li><li>Funded a trust using your lifetime gift exemption<\/li><li>Moved from a high-tax state, such as California, to a tax-free state so that all this wasn\u2019t only federal tax-free, but also state tax-free<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In this scenario, you could consider a rollover if you still have QSBS remaining. Section 1045 allows you to roll over your gain from the sale of QSBS to a replacement QSBS investment within 60 days of selling your stock as long as you held the original QSBS for at least six months and met the other requirements of Section 1202.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve purchased the replacement QSBS investment, so long as you continue to meet the requirements of Section 1202, you can then sell the QSBS and potentially qualify for a new set of benefits\u2014 starting the cycle over again with a new $10 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sample tax savings breakdown:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"714\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table4-5-714x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14118\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table4-5-714x530.png 714w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table4-5-640x475.png 640w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table4-5-768x570.png 768w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table4-5-1536x1140.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mossadams-table4-5-2048x1520.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The challenge<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what\u2019s the catch with attempting to hit a home run or grand slam?
