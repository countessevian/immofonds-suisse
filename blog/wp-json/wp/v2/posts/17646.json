However, many Wealthfront clients have taken the volatility in stride and treated this market environment as an opportunity.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are three takeaways showing how Wealthfront clients are responding to the market\u2019s recent ups and downs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Many Wealthfront clients benefitted greatly from Tax-Loss Harvesting.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While periods of market turbulence can be unnerving, that\u2019s also when Wealthfront\u2019s automated Tax-Loss Harvesting (which is included in all our taxable Automated Investing Accounts at no additional cost) can generate the most value.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the week following the April 2 tariff announcement, from April 3 through April 10, Wealthfront traded over <strong>$8 billion<\/strong> on behalf of clients. Our software also captured more than <strong>$100 million in harvested losses<\/strong> in three days alone (April 3, 4, and 7) to help lower clients\u2019 tax bills. These numbers are unusually high given the higher-than-normal market volatility (for comparison, we harvested a total of $145 million losses in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/tax-loss-harvesting-results-2024\/\">all of 2024<\/a>), but demonstrate how Tax-Loss Harvesting can be a \u201csilver lining\u201d when markets are down.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u00a02. Wealthfront clients weren\u2019t necessarily surprised by this volatility.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we run regular surveys on investor sentiment. In both February and March, only 19% and 16% of clients respectively thought the market would rise over the next six months. And over 75% thought a market \u201ccrash\u201d was either very or somewhat probable in the next six months. As we\u2019ve written many times, it is impossible to predict exactly what financial markets will do in the future. But our surveys suggest that clients were attuned to the shifting environment and weren\u2019t caught off guard by the ensuing volatility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Many Wealthfront clients saw recent market volatility as an investment opportunity.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the pessimistic sentiment about the market, many clients kept investing\u2014a strategy that\u2019s likely to help them in the long run.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, April 3 (the day after the initial tariff announcement) we saw a sharp increase in investment deposits, suggesting many clients saw an opportunity to buy when investment prices were relatively low. <strong>Deposits into Automated Investing Accounts increased by 330% compared to the previous day<\/strong>, and stayed elevated on Friday, April 4. Then on April 9, when the 90-day tariff pause was announced, we observed that the majority of deposits occurred early in the morning before the news broke, suggesting clients were still eager to buy when the market was down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve also seen increased demand for fixed income investing. On Tuesday, April 8, deposits into Automated Bond Ladders hit their highest level so far this year\u2014an indication that many clients are seeking to take advantage of rising Treasury yields and diversify their holdings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wealthfront clients are staying the course<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During periods of market volatility, we think it\u2019s smart to focus on what\u2019s within your control and to keep investing. As we wrote in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/what-to-do-when-stock-market-is-down\/\">recent blog post<\/a>, history suggests that markets tend to rise over time and staying the course is likely to work out in your favor. We\u2019re glad to see so many Wealthfront clients are doing just that.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The past two weeks have been a rollercoaster for financial markets, driven largely by a flurry of announcements related to tariffs.
