It requires trust, a shared vision of your future, and of course, some logistics. When it comes to your household finances, both partners need visibility, control, and access\u2014and sometimes, to keep certain accounts separate. But many financial institutions don\u2019t make that easy, and what <em>should<\/em> feel like a major relationship milestone ends up feeling like a problem to be solved.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve talked with many of our clients to understand this challenge, and we set out to solve it. As a result, we believe we\u2019ve built the best joint experience on the market for your shared savings and wealth-building. <strong>We\u2019re excited to announce that starting today, joint Cash Accounts now have checking features, enabled by shared account &amp; routing numbers, so you and your co-owner can both benefit from direct deposit, debit cards, and the ability to pay shared bills directly from the account.<\/strong> A joint Cash Account also offers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>An industry-leading Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 4.00% from our program banks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A shared view of your finances right in the Wealthfront app when you link your external accounts<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easy transfers between your individual and joint Cash Accounts<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The ability to see which account co-owner handled each Cash Account transaction&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Free 24\/7 instant withdrawals&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to 19,000 free ATMs, and two ATM fee reimbursements per month (up to $7.50 each)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Free wires<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Up to $16 million in FDIC insurance through our program banks ($8 million for individual accounts)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>And as always, no account fees<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wealthfront Cash Account can be a powerful tool for building shared wealth with a partner until you\u2019re ready to invest, and many couples are already using it to reach their goals: The average joint Cash Account balance is an impressive $80,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to level up your joint financial plan? In this post, we\u2019ll explain how you and your partner can get the most out of your joint Cash Account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Set up shared views for a clear picture of your joint finances<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Couples are faced with several choices when they combine finances: share everything, share nothing, or share some things. There isn\u2019t necessarily one right answer\u2014only what works best for your particular situation. Most financial institutions don\u2019t make navigating this decision easy, but Wealthfront supports all three options.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the Wealthfront app, you can see your combined net worth at a glance (accounting for linked external accounts in addition to your Wealthfront accounts) and get a clear picture of where you stand today. Individual accounts that you don\u2019t want to include in this view stay private\u2014that\u2019s totally up to you. Whatever you decide, getting a clear view of your joint finances can help you and your partner make more informed decisions together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"923\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Joint-UI-1-923x530.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17739\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Joint-UI-1-923x530.jpg 923w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Joint-UI-1-640x367.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Joint-UI-1-768x441.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Joint-UI-1-1536x882.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Joint-UI-1-2048x1176.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/07\/Joint-UI-1-280x160.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Direct deposit your paychecks to earn a high APY on every shared dollar<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earning an industry-leading APY on your shared cash can have a big impact on your joint savings over time. But manually transferring both of your paychecks into your Cash Account every pay cycle can be tiresome. Using direct deposit can save you some work, and both you and your co-owner can now easily set up direct deposit in the Wealthfront app.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just use your joint account and routing numbers and follow the instructions from your payroll provider. When you direct deposit your paychecks to your Cash Account, every dollar starts working harder than it would in a traditional, low-interest savings account from the moment it arrives. And with free instant withdrawals available around the clock, every day of the year, you don\u2019t have to worry about your funds being readily accessible in a pinch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get two debit cards so you can both access cash when you need it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re at the farmers market, a yard sale, or a neighborhood lemonade stand, sometimes you just need cash. It\u2019s important to make sure both you and your partner can get what you need quickly and without paying exorbitant ATM fees while you\u2019re at it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wealthfront Cash Account comes with debit cards for both account holders and access to up to more than 19,000 free ATMs nationwide. But what if you or your partner can\u2019t make it to one of those ATMs? We\u2019ll also reimburse two out-of-network ATM fees per month, up to $7.50 each.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Set up recurring deposits for saving and investing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easier to make good financial decisions together when you automate them. That includes setting up automatic transfers from external accounts to your Cash Account (where it can work harder for you by earning an industry-leading APY through our program banks) <em>and<\/em> using automatic transfers from your Cash Account to your investing account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automated deposits to your joint investing account aren\u2019t just convenient\u2014they can help you build long-term wealth together and work towards larger financial goals like retirement or sending a child to college. Some investors struggle to pick the \u201cright\u201d days to invest, and end up sitting on the sidelines as a result. But removing this friction so you can add to your investments consistently over time can be very powerful. By getting into the market, you and your partner can give your savings an opportunity to grow and compound even more over the long term than they would in a Cash Account.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting started will require some conversations with your partner: You should talk about your time horizon, your risk tolerance, and the account type that\u2019s best suited to your goals. For a deeper dive on the tradeoffs of various Wealthfront investing accounts, you can check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/pick-wealthfront-account\/\">this blog post<\/a> on the subject. Whatever you choose, know that the Cash Account is designed to be an ideal place to keep your money until you\u2019re ready to invest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Build long-term wealth, together<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re delighted to offer what we consider to be a best-in-class joint account experience to Wealthfront clients. Our joint Cash Account isn\u2019t just a great place to earn interest and access your money instantly, 24\/7 (although it <em>is<\/em> very good for those things)\u2014together with the Wealthfront app, it\u2019s a true hub for you to manage the full range of financial decisions you\u2019ll make with a partner.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your money is personal, so merging your financial life with a partner is a big deal.
