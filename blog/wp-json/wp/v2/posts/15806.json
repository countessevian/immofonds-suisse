As we\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/how-the-fed-funds-rate-impacts-the-wealthfront-cash-account\/\">written about in the past<\/a>, the fed funds rate is a direct input to the Cash Account Annual Percentage Yield (APY). As a result of the Fed\u2019s decision, the new APY is 4.00%.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new APY is nearly 10x the national average, which means the Cash Account is still an ideal home for your cash until you\u2019re ready to invest. In addition to the high APY, we offer up to $8 million of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/wealthfront-fdic-insurance\/\">FDIC insurance<\/a> through our partner banks with no monthly fees, ever. The Cash Account also comes with many ways to conveniently access your cash, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/free-instant-withdrawals\/\">free instant withdrawals<\/a>, a debit card, compatibility with apps like Venmo &amp; Apple Pay, the ability to send checks for free, and free wire transfers. You can access 19,000+ free ATMs, and we\u2019ll reimburse up to two out-of-network ATM fees per month. You can even use your account and routing numbers to pay bills like your credit card, daycare, and mortgage.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that changing interest rates might make you wonder how to make the most of your savings in the current market conditions. We wrote a <a href=\"http:\/\/wealthfront.com\/blog\/money-when-interest-rates-decrease\/\">blog post<\/a> to help you navigate the current interest rate environment.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is the APY going down?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The APY is highly dependent on the fed funds rate, which is the interest rate at which banks lend each other money, and the basis for most consumer interest rates. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/wealthfront-isnt-a-bank\/\">Wealthfront is not a bank<\/a>, so we work with partner banks where we broker your Cash Account deposits. Those partner banks pay a rate based on a premium relative to the fed funds rate. When the federal funds rate goes up, we are able to raise the APY as we did several times in 2022 and 2023. On the other hand, it also means that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/how-the-fed-funds-rate-impacts-the-wealthfront-cash-account\/\">when the fed funds rate declines, the APY also declines<\/a>. You can rest assured that we\u2019ll continue to navigate relationships with our partner banks so you can benefit from a competitive APY in all rate environments.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An ideal home for your short-term savings and everyday cash<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"o-grid__col-medium--12 o-grid__col--3 c-post__related c-post__box right\"><div class=\"c-post__box-content\">Earn an industry-leading APY on your short-term cash. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/start\/account-type\/for?highLevel=banking&amp;intent=cash&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=pcallout&amp;utm_campaign=cashaccountapy\">Open a Cash Account<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we want to help you build long-term wealth on your own terms.
