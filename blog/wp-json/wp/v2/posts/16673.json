When we launched the Cash Account in 2019 in partnership with our network of FDIC insured banks, we couldn\u2019t have imagined such a positive reception, and we want to send a heartfelt thank you for trusting us with your money. Half a billion dollars in interest earned amounts to $1,014 on average per client year to date*. That\u2019s real money that can be invested for the long term.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Building a financial system that favors people, not institutions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our company mission is to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions. What that means in practice is that we leverage software and automation to deliver real value to you, not just our bottom line. At the end of the day, we want to make money <em>with<\/em> you, not <em>from<\/em> you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were inspired to create the Cash Account because we heard from clients that they needed a better place to store their cash and a frictionless, automated way to invest it. Savings accounts offered by traditional banks did not have the features they were looking for. Because Wealthfront is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/wealthfront-isnt-a-bank\/\">not a bank<\/a>, we were able to meet these needs and provide seamless same-day investing, an industry-leading APY of 4.00% and high FDIC insurance up to $8 million both through our partner banks. We do this by brokering your deposits to FDIC insured partner banks instead of holding them ourselves. This lets Wealthfront take advantage of wholesale interest rates, which means we can pass along more interest to you. That can translate to more money you can invest when you\u2019re ready to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>We couldn\u2019t do this without you<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our efforts to bring innovation to the financial system would only be possible with your trust and support. It\u2019s inspiring to have clients who are so proactive and motivated to make the most of their hard-earned money, and we are beyond grateful that you chose us to support your financial journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for consistently sharing your stories, offering us honest feedback, and helping us improve our products to serve you better. Hearing that our work has played a role in helping you achieve your goals motivates us to work even harder\u2013these are just a few of our favorite emails and comments from clients:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1285\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/blog-quote-A-1285x530.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16676\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/blog-quote-A-1285x530.jpg 1285w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/blog-quote-A-640x264.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/blog-quote-A-768x317.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/blog-quote-A-1536x634.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/blog-quote-A-2048x845.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1285px) 100vw, 1285px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Wealthfront helps you build wealth on your own terms<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our work isn\u2019t even close to over, and we continue to improve how our ecosystem serves you by adding even more features to the Cash Account and rolling out new investing products.
