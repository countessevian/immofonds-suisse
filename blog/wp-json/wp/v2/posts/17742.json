Here\u2019s a closer look at what we\u2019ve shipped recently:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Checking features for joint Cash Accounts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve made the joint Cash Account an even better place to manage your money with a partner\u2014joint Cash Accounts now have checking features, enabled by shared account &amp; routing numbers. In addition to earning an industry-leading 4.00% annual percentage yield (APY) and getting up to $16 million in FDIC insurance from our program banks, you and your co-owner can now use our joint Cash Account to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Direct deposit your paycheck, order a debit card, and pay shared bills right from the account<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make free, instant withdrawals 24\/7<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access 19,000 free ATMs and get two ATM fee reimbursements per month (up to $7.50 each)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Send wires for free<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get a shared view of all of your finances right in the Wealthfront app when you link your external accounts<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make easy transfers between your individual and joint Cash Accounts<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>See which account co-owner initiated each transaction in your joint Cash Account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lower fee for Automated Bond Ladders<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe in minimizing fees when you invest, and that extends to our own products. Earlier this year, we lowered the fee on our Automated Bond Ladder from 0.25% to an 0.15% annual advisory fee. This makes it an even better place to keep extra cash so it earns additional yield without state and local taxes. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/introducing-automated-bond-ladder\/\">learn more about the Automated Bond Ladder here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lower minimum for Wealthfront\u2019s S&amp;P 500 Direct, including fractional shares<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of 2024, we released Wealthfront\u2019s S&amp;P 500 Direct to offer you a new way to upgrade your S&amp;P 500\u00ae investing and unlock tax savings. We recently lowered the minimum for S&amp;P 500 Direct from $20,000 to just $5,000, making it even easier for you to get started. This lower minimum is enabled by fractional shares, which also makes it possible for S&amp;P 500 Direct portfolios to track the underlying index more closely than before. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/sp500-direct\">learn more about S&amp;P 500 Direct here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other improvements<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>New referral bonuses:<\/strong> When you successfully refer someone to Wealthfront, both of you can now get a 0.50% annual percentage yield (APY) boost through our program banks in our Cash Account <em>and<\/em> a 0.50% deposit match in any individual taxable investing account for three months.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Running balance in Cash Accounts: <\/strong>We now show a \u201crunning balance\u201d in your Cash Account so you can better track changes in your account balance over time.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved mobile experience:<\/strong> It\u2019s now easier to update your tax information in our app, and we\u2019ve made it possible to update your account beneficiaries in our app, too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Coming soon<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Securities lending:<\/strong> Starting in August, you\u2019ll have the option to lend securities in eligible investing accounts at Wealthfront in exchange for passive income. You\u2019ll retain ownership of the shares, and they\u2019ll be backed by cash collateral in case of default.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fractional shares in Automated Investing Accounts:<\/strong> Just like we enabled fractional shares in S&amp;P 500 Direct, we\u2019ll be enabling them in Automated Investing Accounts later this year. This change will help minimize tracking error relative to your target allocation, and potentially allow you to hold a smaller portion of your account in cash.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we\u2019re always working to make our products better so you can build wealth on your own terms. We\u2019re delighted to make these new features available to you, and we can\u2019t wait to show you what\u2019s next.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wealthfront products are constantly getting better, and the first half of 2025 was no exception.&nbsp; We made a number of exciting improvements to our products, ranging from lower fees to the release of long-anticipated new features.
