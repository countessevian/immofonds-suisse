What about earnings in my taxable investing account?<\/strong><\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As you gear up for tax season, it\u2019s normal to wonder how your earnings from various accounts will be taxed. While everyone\u2019s tax situation is different and it\u2019s impossible for a blog post to tell you exactly what you specifically will owe, it is possible to share some general principles to help you understand the basics. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do in this post, focusing on Wealthfront\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/cash\">Cash Account<\/a> and taxable investing accounts like our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/investing\">Automated Investing Account<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/automated-bond-ladder\">Automated Bond Ladder<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/automated-bond-portfolio\">Automated Bond Portfolio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/stock-investing\">Stock Investing Account<\/a>, and Wealthfront\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/sp500-direct\">S&amp;P 500 Direct<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into the details, here\u2019s a high-level overview of what you can expect from Wealthfront for your Cash Account and taxable investing accounts this tax season:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you earned more than $10 in interest or $600 in awards in a Wealthfront Cash Account, we\u2019ll send you a 1099. Use this form to file your 2024 tax return.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you have a taxable investment account with dividends or realized capital gains, we\u2019ll send you a Consolidated 1099. Use this form to file your 2024 tax return.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/tax-loss-harvesting\">Tax-Loss Harvesting<\/a> service, you can use your harvested losses to lower what you owe\u2014we automatically include this information in your Consolidated 1099.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: If your tax situation is complicated or you just feel like you need more guidance, it\u2019s smart to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/9-instances-in-which-to-hire-a-tax-accountant\/\">speak with a tax professional<\/a>. With this in mind, here\u2019s a more detailed explanation of how taxes work for the Wealthfront Cash Account and our taxable investing accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Taxes on the Wealthfront Cash Account<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re very proud of the high 4.00% APY (Annual Percentage Yield) you can earn from our partner banks on cash deposits to the Wealthfront Cash Account. This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/how-the-fed-funds-rate-impacts-the-wealthfront-cash-account\/\">APY can change over time<\/a>, but is one of the highest on the market. Because the APY is so high, it\u2019s possible to earn a significant amount of interest on your cash. It\u2019s important to remember that this interest, just like the interest from any high-yield account, is taxed as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/o\/ordinaryincome.asp\">ordinary income<\/a> (just like your paychecks are if you earn a salary).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the federal level, ordinary income is taxed progressively, with marginal rates that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/taxes\/federal-income-tax-brackets\">currently range from 10% all the way up to 37%.<\/a> The rate you\u2019ll pay depends on the total amount of taxable income you have that year and your filing status (single, married filing jointly, etc).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you live in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/taxes\/state-income-tax-rates\">state with income tax<\/a>, you could also owe state income tax on the interest you earn in a high-yield account. State tax treatment of interest varies widely from state to state\u2014for example, in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/taxes\/california-state-tax\">California<\/a>, marginal tax rates currently range from 1% all the way up to 12.3%, while other states (like Florida, Alaska, and Texas for example) have no state income tax at all.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to expect during tax season: <\/strong>If you\u2019re a Wealthfront client and you earned more than $10 of interest (or $600 in awards) during the previous year, we\u2019ll send you a Form 1099 at the start of tax season (usually late January). Use that form when you file your tax return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Taxes on taxable investing accounts like Wealthfront\u2019s Automated Investing Account, Automated Bond Portfolio, Automated Bond Ladder, S&amp;P 500 Direct, or Stock Investing Account<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand how your investments are taxed, it\u2019s important to know the difference between the two types of investing gains: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/personal-finance\/101515\/comparing-longterm-vs-shortterm-capital-gain-tax-rates.asp\">short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains<\/a>. When you sell an investment for more than you paid for it, that is known as \u201crealizing a gain.\u201d Whether that gain is a short-term capital gain or a long-term capital gain depends on how long you held that investment before selling it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gains realized on investments held for a year or less are short-term gains, and they are taxed just like ordinary income (which, as we described above, means it is taxed progressively at&nbsp; federal marginal rates of up to 37% and potentially taxed at the state level depending on where you live).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You realize a long-term capital gain when you sell an investment for more than you paid for it but you held it for longer than one year. Long-term capital gains rates are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates, and range from 0% to 20% at the federal level. As is the case with ordinary income rates, long-term capital gains are different depending on which state you live in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/dividend.asp\">Dividends<\/a> are another source of income for investors. If you earn dividends, those are generally taxable even if you don\u2019t sell the investment. Dividends can be taxed at long-term capital gains rates if they are \u201cqualified,\u201d or as ordinary income if they are not. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/taxes\/dividend-tax-rate\">This article<\/a> does a deeper dive on the details of how dividends are taxed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/the-basics-of-bond-etfs\/\">some dividends from bond ETFs are taxed-advantaged<\/a>\u2014and this applies to you if you have an Automated Bond Portfolio at Wealthfront. Dividends from US Treasury ETFs (which are found in Wealthfront\u2019s Automated Bond Portfolio) are typically exempt from state tax, which can be especially valuable if you live in a higher tax state like California.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, interest from US Treasuries, like those in Wealthfront\u2019s Automated Bond Ladder, are exempt from state taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to expect during tax season:<\/strong> Each tax season, Wealthfront will send you a Consolidated 1099 containing information about all of your long- and short-term capital gains, along with any dividends or interest. Just plug this information into your tax preparation software or share it with your tax professional.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Don\u2019t forget about your harvested losses<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/tax-loss-harvesting\">Tax-loss harvesting<\/a> is a tax-minimization strategy that takes advantage of daily market volatility to improve your after-tax returns. When an investment in your portfolio declines below its purchase price, you can sell that investment, \u201charvest\u201d the loss, and buy a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/w\/washsale.asp\">similar investment<\/a> to retain the overall risk and return characteristics of your portfolio. <strong>At Wealthfront, we automate this strategy at no additional cost in our Automated Investing Account, Automated Bond Portfolio, and S&amp;P 500 Direct.<\/strong> When tax time rolls around, you can then use those harvested losses to offset your taxable gains.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harvested losses first offset any capital gains realized at Wealthfront. Losses beyond that can offset capital gains realized outside of Wealthfront. Losses left over after that can be used to reduce your taxable ordinary income up to $3,000. Any remaining losses after that can be used in a future tax year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to expect during tax season: <\/strong>If you\u2019re a Wealthfront client with Tax-Loss Harvesting enabled in your taxable investing account, we\u2019ll automatically include information about your harvested losses on your Consolidated 1099. If you use TurboTax to file your taxes, your Tax-Loss Harvesting information will be automatically imported when you upload your Consolidated 1099\u2014there are no extra steps to take.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tax season doesn\u2019t need to be taxing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taxes can get complicated, and if you have more questions we encourage you to head over to our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/categories\/360003434572\">Help Center<\/a>, or speak with a tax professional about your unique situation.
