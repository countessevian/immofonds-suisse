It can also be a little bit daunting. After all, money\u2014how much you make, how you spend it, and how you direct it towards your goals\u2014is both important and very personal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you get ready to save and invest with your partner, we have some tips to help you get started. This list isn\u2019t exhaustive (there\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/category\/planning\/couples\/\">a lot to say<\/a> on this subject!), but it\u2019s a good place to begin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Take stock of your current financial situation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step in managing your money with a partner is for both of you to assess your current financial situations. You might find it helpful to get on the same page: You can share how much you both make, talk about your regular expenses, and go over any debts you\u2019re paying down. You can also flag any major upcoming purchases, anticipated windfalls, or items you want to handle individually (rather than jointly). Taken together, these pieces of information will help you form a fuller understanding of how much money is coming in, going out, being saved towards various goals, or getting invested each month.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now is also a good time to make sure both you and your partner have visibility into your shared finances. Can you both see transactions in your joint accounts? Can you both check your account balances if you need to? It\u2019s hard to manage your finances together if you can\u2019t easily get a clear picture of where you are today. Shared visibility can also give you some peace of mind. For example, if you can both see your emergency fund, you can both feel more confident that it\u2019s there if you need it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Talk about your shared financial goals<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the fun part! Now that you\u2019ve determined where you\u2019re starting from, it\u2019s time to decide where you want to go. Do you and your partner dream of buying a home together? Are you both determined to retire early and live off of your investments? Do you want to help your child (or children) pay for college one day?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decide what\u2019s important to you as a couple, and talk through a rough timeline for reaching those goals. This timeline will help you set a realistic plan that reflects both your current financial reality and your biggest priorities. For example, let\u2019s imagine you and your partner want to buy a condo in the city where you live within the next three years. Once you\u2019ve determined that\u2019s your highest priority goal, you can estimate the down payment you will need and calculate roughly how much money to save each month over the next three years.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Divide up the tasks and automate them whenever possible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Odds are, you and your partner divide up household chores: You probably don\u2019t do the laundry <em>and<\/em> the dishes <em>and<\/em> all of the yard work. Similarly, you and your partner will likely want to split up responsibility for regularly occurring financial tasks, too. These tasks might feel small and uninspiring on their own, but together, they\u2019ll move you and your partner closer to the goals you agreed on. And in many cases, you may be able to automate them (more on that below).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let\u2019s talk about the kind of tasks that you\u2019ll need to assign. Some common ones include moving money between accounts, investing on a regular schedule, and paying bills. We suggest starting a list of all of the financial tasks you and your partner handle in a given month. Once you feel pretty confident you\u2019ve captured all of your regularly occurring financial tasks, split them with your partner in a way that feels fair to both of you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got your list of tasks, consider using automation to speed things up. Recurring deposits, automated investing, and\u2014if you\u2019re feeling really fancy\u2014an <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360045189471-Setting-up-your-automated-savings-plan\">automated savings plan<\/a> (like what Wealthfront offers) can save you a lot of time and make it easier to hit your goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Discuss how and when you\u2019ll check in<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, managing your finances with a partner isn\u2019t a single conversation: It\u2019s a dialogue that evolves over time as your goals and circumstances change. Talk with your partner about how often you want to look over your finances together, and decide what frequency makes sense for your situation (monthly, quarterly, etc). These check-ins don\u2019t have to be somber meetings with slides and spreadsheets\u2014you can turn them into date nights and use them as an opportunity to celebrate your wins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Build wealth together at Wealthfront<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, make it easy to save and invest with your partner, whether you grow your short-term money in our high-yield <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/cash\">Cash Account<\/a>, save for a known future expense with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/automated-bond-ladder\">Automated Bond Ladder<\/a>, or build long-term wealth with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/investing\">Automated Investing Account<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>If you and your partner have a Joint Cash Account: <\/strong>We\u2019ve made some recent improvements so it\u2019s even easier to save with your partner in a Wealthfront Cash Account, and we\u2019ll be adding checking features soon.
