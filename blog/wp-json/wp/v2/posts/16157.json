Read more about it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/cash-account-APY\">here<\/a>\n.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all savings accounts and cash accounts are created equal. They can have big differences, like how much <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/cash-account-2m-fdic-insurance\/\">FDIC insurance<\/a> they offer, what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/bank-fees-and-how-to-avoid-them\/\">account fees<\/a> they charge, and which features they make available. But arguably the most consequential difference between accounts is how much interest they pay you for your savings. <strong>If you keep your money in a low-yield savings or cash account, you could be leaving hundreds <strong>\u2014<\/strong> if not thousands <strong>\u2014<\/strong> of dollars of free money on the table. <\/strong>In fact, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/the-42-billion-question-why-arent-americans-ditching-big-banks-11670472623\">recent analysis by the<em> Wall Street Journal<\/em><\/a> found that in Q3 of 2022 alone, Americans could have collectively earned a staggering $42 billion more in interest if they had moved their cash from one of the five biggest banks in the country to one of the five savings accounts with the highest APYs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll run the numbers to illustrate this phenomenon on an individual level and show you how to calculate it for yourself. We hope this information will help you confidently choose the right home for your cash, and we hope you\u2019ll consider the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/cash\">Wealthfront Cash Account<\/a> for the job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How low-yield accounts cost you money<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of December 19, 2022, the average interest rate for savings accounts is 0.30% according to FDIC.gov. That means if you have $10,000 in a savings account which is compounding monthly and earning the national average, your money will grow by a relatively uninspiring $30.04 over the course of one year and a disappointing $304.51 over the course of an <em>entire decade.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s still better than the deal you\u2019ll get at some large banks. One large bank in the U.S. (with tens of millions of households as clients) pays a paltry 0.01% APY. At that rate, your $10,000 will earn just $1 over the course of a year and just $10.00 over the course of a decade with monthly compounding.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront\u2019s Cash Account, by comparison, has a 3.80% APY as of January 10, 2023. This is one of the highest APYs on the market, and it has the power to help your savings grow much faster than they would in a low-yield account. In one year, a $10,000 deposit earning a 3.80% APY&nbsp; would earn $379.44. After 10 years at that rate, your deposits would have grown by $4,512.45 with monthly compounding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chart below can help you visualize this stark difference:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1634\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/highcostlowyeildaccounts_R3-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Chart showing how $10,000 grows at various APYs over the course of a decade\" class=\"wp-image-16160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/highcostlowyeildaccounts_R3-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/highcostlowyeildaccounts_R3-640x409.jpg 640w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/highcostlowyeildaccounts_R3-830x530.jpg 830w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/highcostlowyeildaccounts_R3-768x490.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/highcostlowyeildaccounts_R3-1536x980.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/highcostlowyeildaccounts_R3-2048x1307.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: Wealthfront, 2023<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, there can be a very high opportunity cost to earning a low yield on your cash savings over a long period of time. While the differences aren\u2019t huge over the course of a single year, the gap grows markedly over time thanks to the power of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/what-is-compounding\/\">compounding<\/a>. And luckily, it\u2019s easy to avoid missing out on the higher earnings \u2014 you just need to keep your savings at an institution you trust to consistently pay you a competitive APY over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calculating the opportunity cost of a low-yield account in your particular situation is easy. We suggest using an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aprtoapy.com\/\">online calculator<\/a> to convert your bank\u2019s APY into an interest rate if needed (APY takes into account the impact of compounding while interest rates do not) and plugging that rate into a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investor.gov\/financial-tools-calculators\/calculators\/compound-interest-calculator\">this one from Investor.gov<\/a>. The results may surprise you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find a good home for your cash<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t leave money on the table \u2014 keep your cash with an institution that will help it grow. We built the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/cash\">Wealthfront Cash Account<\/a> to be an ideal home for your short-term savings.
