Even those who seek out the latest research and data may have trouble tracking every variable.</p><p>To help you build a smarter long-term plan, Wealthfront Software LLC (“Wealthfront” or “we or “us”) built a financial planning service that combines your financial data with a sophisticated personal finance model to project your financial future. With this financial planning service, you can explore various possible financial outcomes to find a long-term plan that works for you – all based on the latest data from your linked financial accounts, your tolerance for risk, your current investments, and our sophisticated personal finance model built by our research team.</p></td></tr><tr class="horizontal"><td class="col-md-6"><p class="strong">2.
