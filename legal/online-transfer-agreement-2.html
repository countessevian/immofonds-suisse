          This agreement for online funds transfers (“Agreement”) provides the terms and conditions under which a Wealthfront client may from time to time request a funds transfer (ACH transfer
          or, if enabled, wire transfer) online from a Wealthfront account to another account at another financial institution (the “Service”) using a personal computer or compatible mobile
          device.
        </p>
        <p>
          By selecting “Agree and continue” to the terms of the Agreement for online funds transfer below, Client consents to receive, in electronic form, the Agreement and related transaction
          disclosures and agrees to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent applicable, this Agreement is subject to Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code – Fund Transfers as adopted by the State of California. If Client originates a wire
          transfer, Client agrees that the Fedwire Funds Service may be used. Federal Reserve Board Regulation J is the law that covers transactions made over Fedwire Funds Service.

          The word Business Day means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or U.S. bank or financial market holiday.  The word Client refers to the Wealthfront client who agrees below to the

          Wealthfront will rely on the information Client provides in making a funds transfer on Client’s behalf. Client understands that it is Client’s responsibility to provide Wealthfront
          with accurate information regarding that transfer, including the identity of the beneficiary bank, account number of the beneficiary of the funds transfer and, where applicable, the
          number identifying the beneficiary institution, because payment will be processed based on the information provided by Client.  Should Client provide an incorrect account number,
          amount and/or beneficiary bank or beneficiary identifier, Client understands and agrees that any and all resulting losses will be Client’s responsibility.

      </td>
      <td class="col-md-18">
        <p>
          Client agrees that Wealthfront will initiate a funds transfer request for Client after (i) Client supplies information and/or documentation to verify their identity, the identity of
          their beneficiary and the beneficiary bank, and provides any other information, or takes any other steps, that Wealthfront deems, in its sole discretion, necessary in connection with
          the funds transfer and (ii) Wealthfront follows its internal policies and procedures (the “Security Procedures”) in order to initiate a funds transfer request or to complete or confirm
          Client’s instructions for a funds transfer request. Wealthfront shall not be liable for any delay in processing Client’s funds transfer request if Client fails timely to provide this
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the Security Procedures is to verify the authenticity of a transfer request delivered to Wealthfront in Client’s name.  The purpose is not to detect errors in the
          transmission or content of a transfer request. Client agrees the Security Procedures are commercially reasonable and, in view of Wealthfront’s requirements, is a satisfactory method of
          verifying the authenticity of Client’s transfer requests. Client agrees Client is bound by any transfer request, whether or not authorized, that is issued in Client’s name and accepted
          by Wealthfront in compliance with the Security Procedures.

      </td>
      <td class="col-md-18">
        <p>
          If Client’s funds transfer request is received by Wealthfront on a day that is not a Business Day or on a Business Day after 4:30 PM eastern time, it will not be processed until the
          next Business Day.  Wealthfront may also need to confirm Client instructions prior to processing Client’s request, which may result in transfers not receiving same-day service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Client understands that Wealthfront uses a variety of banking channels and facilities to make funds transfers, but will ordinarily use electronic means. Wealthfront may choose any
          conventional means that it considers suitable to transfer funds to Client’s beneficiary. Wealthfront may send transfer request by wire, telegraph, telephone, cable, or whatever other
          transmission method Wealthfront considers to be reasonable. Wealthfront may transmit a transfer request directly to the beneficiary’s bank, or indirectly to the beneficiary’s bank
          through another bank, government agency, or other third party that Wealthfront considers to be reasonable. Wealthfront may utilize any reasonably selected funds transfer system or
          intermediary bank. After Wealthfront executes Client’s request through an intermediary bank, that bank is responsible to complete Client’s request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Client acknowledges and agrees that Client’s transfer request will also be governed by the applicable operating rules and other governing documents for the applicable funds transfer
          system. If there is a conflict between those operating rules and this Agreement, this Agreement will govern.

      </td>
      <td class="col-md-18">
        <p>
          If Client identifies any errors in transfer request, or unauthorized activity on Client’s funding account, Client must contact Wealthfront immediately at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:support@wealthfront.com" class="">support@wealthfront.com</a> and
          (844) 995-8437. Wealthfront will not be responsible for any delays in payment or additional fees caused by Client’s failure to promptly notify Wealthfront. Client agrees that Client
          must contact Wealthfront within thirty (30) days after Client receives notification that Client’s funds transfer request has been executed to report any suspected errors or
          unauthorized activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Client will exercise ordinary care to determine whether a transfer request accepted by Wealthfront was either erroneous or not authorized. If Client’s funds transfer request (including
          a request to recall or amend a request) is erroneous in any way, Client agrees to pay the amount of such funds transfer and all related fees, whether or not the error could have been
          detected by any security procedure, unless such payment is prohibited by applicable laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Client’s transfer request describes the person to receive the funds transfer, i.e. the beneficiary, inconsistently by name and account number, the transfer may be made on the basis
          of the account number even if the account number identifies a person different from the beneficiary. If a transfer request describes a financial institution inconsistently by name and
          identification number, the identification number may be relied upon as the proper identification of the financial institution. Client acknowledges that Client is responsible for
          providing Wealthfront with all information required by the beneficiary’s bank, including the reason for payment, if required. Sending funds transfers without the required information
          can cause the transfer to be delayed, returned, or assessed additional fees. Client further acknowledges the beneficiary account number and beneficiary’s bank identification number
          Client provides in connection with Client’s transfer request will be complete and accurate, and Client understands Client could lose the transfer amount if the information is incorrect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any action Wealthfront takes to detect an erroneous transfer request, or any actions Wealthfront takes beyond those described above in an attempt to detect an unauthorized transfer
          request, will be taken at Wealthfront’s sole discretion. No matter how many times Wealthfront takes this action, it will not become part of Wealthfront’s standard procedures for
          attempting to detect such erroneous or unauthorized transfer requests, and Wealthfront will not in any situation be liable for failing to take or to correctly perform the action.

      </td>
      <td class="col-md-18">
        <p>
          Client may cancel or amend a funds transfer request only if Wealthfront receives such a cancellation or amendment request prior to the execution of the funds transfer request and at a
          time that provides Wealthfront with a reasonable opportunity to act upon that request.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Client’s funds transfer request has been executed by Wealthfront, Client understands and agrees that the request to cancel or amend the funds transfer will be effective only with
          the voluntary consent of Wealthfront and the beneficiary bank. If Client decides to cancel or amend a funds transfer and Client’s request has already been executed, Wealthfront will
          first have to check with the beneficiary bank to determine whether or not the beneficiary bank will return Client’s funds. If the beneficiary bank confirms that the funds are
          returnable and agrees to do so, once the funds are returned to Wealthfront by the beneficiary bank, Wealthfront will return the funds to Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any charges assessed by the beneficiary bank or intermediary bank related to the return will be deducted from any refund.  An amount that is returned to Client may be less than Client
          originally transferred because of service charges of the beneficiary bank, intermediary bank and/or Wealthfront.  Any returned funds will be in U.S. dollars. Wealthfront shall not be
          liable to Client for any loss resulting from the failure of the beneficiary bank and/or intermediary bank to accept a cancellation or amendment of Client’s funds transfer request.

          When Client requests that Wealthfront make a funds transfer, Client must select a financial institution as the beneficiary bank (i.e., recipient bank) for the transfer and provide all
          required information set forth in Section 5 of this Agreement and any other information Wealthfront deems, in its sole discretion, necessary to effectuate the funds transfer including,
          but not limited to, the account and routing numbers of the beneficiary bank. The beneficiary bank must be a member of the Federal Reserve System or a correspondent bank of such a
          member, or a Clearing House Interbank Payment System (CHIPS) member.
        </p>

          Client may request that the funds be deposited into a particular account at the beneficiary bank. The beneficiary bank is responsible for following Client’s instructions and for

          beneficiary bank is responsible for locating, identifying, and making payment to Client or the designated beneficiary. If Client identifies a beneficiary by name and account number,
          the beneficiary's bank may pay the funds to the person identified by the account number, and Client’s payment may be final even if the account number provided does not correspond to
          Client’s beneficiary. If the beneficiary bank is unable to locate an account, the funds may be returned.
