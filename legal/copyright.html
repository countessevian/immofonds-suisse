  <p>Wealthfront Corporation. (“Wealthfront”) respects copyright law and expects
  its users to do the same. In accordance with the Digital Millennium

  if properly notified that files infringe a copyright, remove or
  disable access to such files. Wealthfront reserves the right to remove
  or disable access to files or links to allegedly infringing material
  without prior notice, to the extent it is technologically possible
  given the nature of the Site.</p>

  <p><span class="strong">Notice:</span> If you are a copyright owner, authorized to act on
  behalf of one, or authorized to act under any exclusive right under
  copyright, please report alleged copyright infringements taking place
  on or through the Site or Wealthfront services by completing the
  following DMCA notice (“Notice”) and delivering it to Wealthfront’s
  Designated Copyright Agent. Upon receipt of a Notice, Wealthfront will
  take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate,
  including removal of the challenged content from the Site.</p>

  <p><span class="strong">Counter Notice:</span> Once an appropriate Notice of claimed
  infringement is received, Wealthfront will follow the procedures
  provided in the DMCA, which set forth a notice and takedown procedure,
  subject to the alleged infringer’s right to submit a
  counter-notification claiming lawful use of the copyright or other
  intellectual property interest that is allegedly infringed.  Please
  note that any Notices or counter notices received may be sent to
  Wealthfront’s legal advisors.</p>
