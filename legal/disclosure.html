  <p>
    Wealthfront Advisers LLC (“Wealthfront Advisers”) is an SEC-registered investment adviser. Wealthfront Brokerage LLC
    (”Wealthfront Brokerage”), member FINRA / SIPC, provides brokerage products and services. Wealthfront Software LLC
    (“Wealthfront Software”) offers a free software-based financial advice engine that delivers automated financial
    planning tools to help users achieve better outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Advisers, Wealthfront Brokerage, and Wealthfront Software are all wholly-owned subsidiaries of
    Wealthfront Corporation (“Wealthfront”). Wealthfront and its affiliates operate a website at www.Wealthfront.com
    (the "Site" (which includes our blog)) and a mobile application (the "App").
  </p>

    All product names, logos, and brands are property of their respective owners. Use of these names, logos, and brands
    is for identification purposes only, and does not imply endorsement or affiliation.
  </p>
  <h2 id="wealthfront-advisers">Wealthfront Advisers</h2>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Advisers provides investment advisory services only to investors who are advisory clients of Wealthfront
    Advisers ("Clients") pursuant to written advisory client agreements, which investors are urged to read and carefully
    consider in determining whether such agreements are suitable for their individual facts and circumstances. (Please
    refer to <a href="../legal.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a> website to
    review documents including but not limited to: ADV, Form CRS, and Client Agreements.). Wealthfront Advisers does not
    provide personalized financial planning, such as estate, tax, or retirement planning. Nothing on the Site or the App
    should be construed as a solicitation or offer, or recommendation, to buy or sell any security.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      Past Performance Is No Guarantee Of Future Results, And Any Expected Returns Or Hypothetical Projections May Not
      Reflect Actual Future Performance. Furthermore, Past Returns May Reflect The Performance Of Assets For A Finite
      Time, Or During A Period Of Extreme Market Activity. All Investments Involve Risk And May Lose Money.
    </strong>
    There can be no assurance that an investment mix or any projected or actual performance shown on the Site or App
    will lead to the expected results shown or perform in any predictable or specific manner. It should not be assumed
    that investors will experience returns comparable to those shown or that any or all Clients actually experienced
    such returns.
  </p>
  <p>
    In accounts in which Wealthfront Advisers employs its investment strategies, including portfolio rebalancing and
    tax-loss harvesting, high levels of trading may occur. High levels of trading could result in (a) bid-ask spread
    expense; (b) trade executions that may occur at prices beyond the bid-ask spread (if quantity demanded exceeds
    quantity available at the bid or ask); (c) trading that may adversely move prices, such that subsequent transactions
    occur at less favorable prices; (d) trading that may disqualify some dividends from qualified dividend treatment;
    (e) unfulfilled orders or portfolio drift, in the event that markets are disorderly or trading halts altogether; and
    (f) unforeseen trading errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you transfer your outside account to an account managed by Wealthfront Advisers, we will apply our algorithms to
    sell your transferred account, seeking to minimize any potentially negative tax impact and optimizing for other
    factors, and invest the proceeds into a Wealthfront portfolio. If you transfer assets from one Wealthfront account
    to another Wealthfront account your transferred assets may also be liquidated by the software. Liquidating your
    transferred account may cause, among other things, realized capital gains or losses in specific securities,
    surrender fees, and redirection of declared dividends or distributions. You should also be aware that liquidating
    securities prior to transferring an account to be invested in a Wealthfront portfolio may subject you to the same
    risks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clients should be aware that in some limited instances it may be difficult or impossible to trade the Clients’
    securities. This liquidity risk may be caused by numerous factors, including but not limited to: 1) extreme market
    volatility, 2) a decision by exchange participants to withhold some or all of their quoted market bids, 3) exchange
    technical issues or exchange closure, 4) delisted or halted securities, and/or 5) a position across Client accounts
    that is large relative to the average daily trading volume of the security.
  </p>
  <h2 id="wealthfront-advisers-process">Wealthfront Advisers' Process</h2>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Advisers' methodology is based on Modern Portfolio Theory, for which the Nobel Prize was awarded in
    1990. It is considered state-of-the-art portfolio modeling, but is only one possible way to invest. Clients should
    be aware that Wealthfront Advisers’ process is based in part on a careful evaluation of past price performance and
    volatility in order to evaluate future probabilities. Although Wealthfront Advisers seeks multiple asset classes for
    its Clients in order to diversify portfolios, it is possible that different or unrelated asset classes may all
    exhibit similar price changes in similar directions. This correlation of price behavior may adversely affect a
    Client, and may become more acute in times of market upheaval or high volatility.
  </p>
  <h2 id="client-defined-portfolios">Client-Defined Portfolios</h2>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Advisers offers accounts in which Clients may request to purchase or sell specific securities or elect
    to customize the securities and allocations in their investment account(s).
  </p>

  <h2 id="recommended-portfolios">Recommended Portfolios</h2>
  <h4>Classic Portfolio</h4>
  <p>
    Wealthfront uses low cost, index-based exchange traded funds (ETFs) in its Classic Portfolio to represent the
    following asset classes: US Stocks Foreign, Developed Market Stocks, Emerging Market Stocks, Dividend Growth Stocks,
    US Bonds, US Corporate Bonds, Emerging Market Bonds, Municipal Bonds, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
    (TIPS), Real Estate, and Commodities. Clients are recommended a portfolio based on the results of a risk
    questionnaire, which evaluates their ability and willingness to take risk. Read more about the investment
    methodology in our whitepaper
    <a
      href="https://research.wealthfront.com/whitepapers/investment-methodology/"
      target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
      >here</a
    >.
  </p>
  <h4>Socially Responsible Investing Portfolio</h4>
  <p>
    Certain ETFs available to Wealthfront’s clients are labeled by Wealthfront as “Socially Responsible”. In order to be
    labeled as socially responsible, an ETF must meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) The ETF tracks an
    index marketed as seeking to adhere to socially responsible or ESG principles through the selection and weighting of
    its constituents (2) The ETF tracks an index which specifically excludes companies involved in environmentally
    destructive businesses such as oil and gas exploration and refining, thermal coal, oil sands, palm oil harvesting,
    or unsustainable production of forest products (3) The ETF tracks an index which favors companies, via the selection
    or weighting of its constituents, engaged in businesses related to: clean or renewable energy; electric vehicles or
    clean transportation; or sustainable agriculture and/or forestry (4) The ETF tracks an index which favors companies,
    via the selection or weighting of its constituents with policies and practices supporting of empowerment of women,
    minorities, or members of any disadvantaged class, or the inclusion of women, minorities, or members of any
    disadvantaged class in leadership positions. Clients are recommended a portfolio based on the results of a risk
    questionnaire, which evaluates their ability and willingness to take risk. Read more about the investment
    methodology in our SRI whitepaper
    <a
      href="https://research.wealthfront.com/whitepapers/socially-responsible-portfolios/"
      target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
      >here</a
    >.
  </p>
  <h4>US Direct Indexing</h4>
  <p>
    US Direct Indexing requires a minimum of $100k and Clients authorize Wealthfront Advisers to effect transactions in
    their accounts in accordance with their elections. However, such Clients also understand and agree that Wealthfront
    Advisers retains full discretion over the securities and allocations in their portfolio. In certain situations, the
    securities and allocations in a Client’s portfolio may differ from securities and allocations elected by the Client.
    A lack of liquidity, market conditions, unavailable pricing, software failure, tax considerations, wash sale
    prevention, and other factors may prevent Wealthfront Advisers from effecting transactions in accordance with a
    Client’s specified election. Clients should note that ETF categorization and descriptions are not the views of
    Wealthfront Advisers, but of third-parties, including ETF issuers, made available by Wealthfront Advisers for your
    convenience. Clients should always read an ETF’s prospectus prior to making any investment decision.
  </p>
  <h2 id="smart-beta">Smart Beta</h2>
  <p>
    Smart Beta requires a minimum of $500k and blends five single-factor strategies (momentum, high profitability, high
    dividend yield, low market beta, and low volatility) with the cap-weighted market index to generate a modified
    index. This index then serves as the benchmark for our US Direct Indexing service, which seeks to maximize the
    quantity of harvested losses while minimizing the tracking error from the supplied benchmark. Read more about the
    methodology for Smart Beta in our whitepaper
    <a href="https://research.wealthfront.com/whitepapers/smart-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Wealthfront Risk
    Parity Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the prospectus, which can be
    obtained by calling toll free 877-910-4232. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. For the full
    disclosures related to the Wealthfront Risk Parity Fund, please refer to the current prospectus, available here.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more information regarding the risks of investing in the Fund, please see the Principal Investment Risks section
    of the Fund's prospectus. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
  </p>
  <h2 id="etf-disclosures">ETF Disclosures</h2>
  <p>
    The securities employed in certain Client accounts include exchange-traded funds or other publicly registered funds
    ("ETFs"), which generally are registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Although
    Wealthfront Advisers believes its selection process identifies ETFs with high liquidity, low expenses, and low
    tracking error, Wealthfront Advisers’ selection process does not guarantee the quality of a particular ETF or that
    it will 1) be profitable, 2) properly track any comparable index, 3) trade in a liquid fashion, or 4) trade at or
    above its publicly-posted net asset value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Advisers reserves the right to change at any time the selection of ETFs that it recommends if, in
    Wealthfront Advisers’ sole discretion, any ETF does not meet requirements for continued listing on the platform.
    Clients should be aware that changes in the selection of ETFs employed by Wealthfront Advisers’ investment
    management service may result in the sale of their existing holdings and may subject them to additional tax
    liability.
  </p>
  <p>
    An ETF typically includes embedded expenses that may reduce its net asset value and therefore directly affect its
    performance and indirectly affect a Client’s portfolio performance or an index benchmark comparison. These embedded
    expenses may include management fees, custodian fees, and legal and accounting fees. ETF expenses may change from
    time to time at the sole discretion of the ETF issuer. Wealthfront Advisers discloses each ETF’s current
    information, including expenses, on the Site and App. ETF tracking error and expenses may vary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, ETF performance may not exactly match the performance of the index or market benchmark that the ETF is
    designed to track because 1) the ETF incurs expenses and transaction costs not incurred by any applicable index or
    market benchmark; 2) certain securities comprising the index or market benchmark tracked by the ETF may, from time
    to time, temporarily be unavailable; and 3) supply and demand in the market for either the ETF and/or for the
    securities held by the ETF may cause the ETF shares to trade at a premium or discount to the actual net asset value
    of the securities owned by the ETF.
  </p>
  <p>
    Certain ETF strategies may from time to time include fixed income, commodities, foreign securities, American
    Depositary Receipts, or other securities for which expenses could be higher than otherwise charged for
    exchange-traded equity securities, and for which market quotations or valuation may be limited or inaccurate.
  </p>
  <h2 id="performance-disclosures">Performance Disclosures</h2>
  <p>
    Performance information is presented net of all management fees and expenses, unless marked otherwise. Commissions
    are not considered since Clients on the Wealthfront Advisers’ platform are not charged trading commissions. For all
    time periods, the performance information includes the reinvestment of dividends and interest unless otherwise
    noted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any comparison to traditional financial advisors is based on an evaluation of average fees and returns. Actual
    results may be different for each investor and there can be no guarantee of enhanced returns due to additional
    diversification, ETF selection, or the use of Wealthfront Advisers’ investment management service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Investors who become Clients may experience different results than what is reflected in available hypothetical
    results. There is a potential for loss, as well as gain, that may not be reflected in hypothetical information. The
    hypothetical performance results shown do not represent the results of actual trading using Client assets but were
    achieved by means of the retroactive application of a model designed with the benefit of hindsight. Investors should
    carefully review all additional information presented by Wealthfront Advisers as part of any hypothetical
    comparison.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any comparisons to indices are provided for illustrative purposes only. An index is a broadly diversified, unmanaged
    group of securities, which may include only large capitalization companies or companies of a certain size. Broadly
    based indices may be shown only as an indication of the general performance of the financial markets during the
    periods indicated. Because of the differences between the client allocations and any indices shown, Wealthfront
    Advisers cautions investors that no index is directly comparable to the performance shown since each index has its
    own unique results and volatility, and such indices, if shown, should not be relied upon as an accurate comparison.
  </p>
  <p>
    The return, composite, and performance information shown on the Site or App uses or includes information compiled
    from third-party sources, including independent market quotations and index information. Wealthfront Advisers
    believes the third-party information comes from reliable sources, but Wealthfront Advisers does not guarantee the
    accuracy of the Site or App information and may receive incorrect information from third-party providers. Unless
    otherwise indicated, the information on the Site or App has been prepared by Wealthfront Advisers and has not been
    reviewed, compiled or audited by any independent third-party or public accountant.
  </p>
  <h2 id="fee-and-account-disclosures">Fee and Account Disclosures</h2>
  <p>
    Recommendations and fees may vary for each Client. Advisory fees for a fully discretionary account are calculated
    for each Client based upon the amount of assets being managed for that Client (as detailed further in Wealthfront
    Advisers’ Form ADV Part 2).
  </p>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Advisers does not make any representations regarding the execution quality of orders placed with our
    executing broker-dealer partner. However, Wealthfront Advisers does monitor the execution quality of transactions to
    ensure that Clients receive the best overall trade execution pursuant to regulatory requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Description of "Free." Certain ETF products, offered through Wealthfront Advisers, may be free of commissions;
    however, management and/or other fees may be charged for investment products managed by outside companies, which are
    unaffiliated entities of Wealthfront Advisers.
  </p>

  <h2 id="portfolio-line-of-credit">Portfolio Line of Credit</h2>
  <p>
    Portfolio Line of Credit is a margin lending product offered by Wealthfront Brokerage exclusively to Clients of
    Wealthfront Advisers. Margin lending can add to your overall investment risk, and you should consider the risks and
    benefits specific to margin when evaluating your overall financial strategy. Learn more about these risks in the
    <a
      href="../static/documents/wbc/margin_handbook.pdf"
      target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
      >Margin Handbook</a
    >.
  </p>
  <h2 id="tax-and-tax-loss-harvesting-disclosures">Tax and Tax-Loss Harvesting Disclosures</h2>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Advisers does not represent in any manner that the tax consequences described as part of its Tax-Loss
    Harvesting service will be achieved or that Wealthfront Advisers’ Tax-Loss Harvesting service, or any of its
    products and/or services, will result in any particular tax consequences. The tax consequences of its Tax-Loss
    Harvesting service and other strategies that Wealthfront Advisers may pursue are complex and uncertain and may be
    challenged by the IRS. Wealthfront does not provide tax advice to Clients. The information with regard to this
    service was not prepared to be used, and cannot be relied upon, by any investor to avoid penalties or interest. In
    addition, the performance of the alternate securities purchased through its Tax-Loss Harvesting service may be
    better or worse than the performance of the securities that are sold for tax-loss harvesting purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Advisers’ investment strategies, including portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, can lead to
    high levels of trading. High levels of trading could result in (a) bid-ask spread expense; (b) trade executions that
    may occur at prices beyond the bid ask spread (if quantity demanded exceeds quantity available at the bid or ask);
    (c) trading that may adversely move prices, such that subsequent transactions occur at worse prices; (d) trading
    that may disqualify some dividends from qualified dividend treatment; (e) unfulfilled orders or portfolio drift, in
    the event that markets are disorderly or trading halts altogether; and (f) unforeseen trading errors. The
    performance of the new securities purchased through its Tax-Loss Harvesting service may be better or worse than the
    performance of the securities that are sold for tax-loss harvesting purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clients should confer with their personal tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of investing with Wealthfront
    Advisers and engaging in its Tax-Loss Harvesting service, based on their particular circumstances. Clients and their
    personal tax advisors are responsible for how the transactions conducted in an account are reported to the IRS or
    any other taxing authority on the Client’s personal tax returns. Wealthfront Advisers assumes no responsibility for
    the tax consequences to any Client of any transaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ability to utilize losses harvested through the strategy will depend upon the recognition of capital gains in
    the same or a future tax period, and in addition may be subject to limitations under applicable tax laws. Losses
    harvested through the strategy that are not utilized in the tax period when recognized (e.g., because of
    insufficient capital gains and/or significant capital loss carryforwards), generally may be carried forward to
    offset future capital gains, if any. Except as set forth below, Wealthfront Advisers will monitor only a Client’s
    accounts at Wealthfront Advisers to determine if there are unrealized losses for purposes of determining whether to
    harvest such losses. Transactions outside of such accounts may affect whether a loss is successfully harvested and,
    if so, whether that loss is usable by the Client in the most efficient manner. The effectiveness of its Tax-Loss
    Harvesting strategy to reduce the tax liability of the Client will depend on the Client’s entire tax and investment
    profile, including purchases and dispositions in a Client’s accounts outside of Wealthfront Advisers and type of
    investments (e.g., taxable or nontaxable) or holding period (e.g., short-term or long-term).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Client is responsible for monitoring the accounts of the Client and the Client’s spouse, if any, that are held
    outside of Wealthfront Advisers to ensure that transactions in the same security or a substantially identical
    security do not create a “wash sale.” A wash sale is the sale at a loss and purchase of the same security or
    substantially identical security over a period of 61 calendar days: the day of the sale, the 30 days before the
    sale, and the 30 days after the sale. If a wash sale transaction occurs, the IRS may not allow or defer the loss for
    current tax reporting purposes. Wash sales can occur even if the securities are sold and then bought in different
    accounts. Therefore, Wealthfront Advisers may lack visibility to certain wash sales, should they occur as a result
    of external or unlinked accounts, and therefore Wealthfront Advisers may not be able to provide notice of such wash
    sales in advance of the Client's receipt of the IRS Form 1099. The effectiveness of the tax-loss harvesting strategy
    to reduce the tax liability of the Client will depend on the Client’s entire tax and investment profile, including
    purchases and dispositions in a Client’s (or Client’s spouse’s) accounts outside of Wealthfront Advisers and type of
    investments (e.g., taxable or nontaxable) or holding period (e.g., short-term or long-term). Except as set forth
    below, Wealthfront Advisers will monitor only a Client’s (or Client’s spouse’s) accounts at Wealthfront Advisers to
    determine if there are unrealized losses for purposes of determining whether to harvest such losses. Transactions
    outside of such accounts may affect whether a loss is successfully harvested and, if so, whether that loss is usable
    by the Client in the most efficient manner. A Client may also request that Wealthfront Advisers monitor the Client’s
    spouse’s accounts or their IRA accounts at Wealthfront Advisers to avoid the wash sale disallowance rule. A Client
    may request spousal monitoring online or by calling Wealthfront Advisers at 844.995.8437. If Wealthfront Advisers is
    monitoring multiple accounts to avoid the wash sale disallowance rule, the first taxable account to trade a security
    will block the other account(s) from trading in that same security for 30 days.
  </p>
  <h2 id="cash-account">Cash Account</h2>
  <p>
    Wealthfront Brokerage establishes and carries accounts for Clients to hold funds for the purpose of investing and
    records transactions pursuant to Client discretion and instructions (a “Cash Account”). Neither Wealthfront
    Brokerage nor its affiliates is a bank. Checking features for a Cash Account are subject to identity verification by
    Green Dot Bank. The Wealthfront Cash Account Visa® Debit Card is optional and must be requested, and it is issued by
    Green Dot Bank, Member FDIC, pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. Visa is a registered trademark of Visa
    International Service Association. Green Dot Bank operates under the following registered trade names: GO2bank,
    GoBank, Green Dot Bank, and Bonneville Bank. All of these registered trade names are used by, and refer to, a single

  <p>
    Early availability of a direct deposit depends on timing of payor’s payment instructions and fraud prevention
    restrictions may apply. As such, the availability or timing of early direct deposit may vary from pay period to pay
    period. Interest does not begin accruing until funds arrive at the program banks, which may take up to one business
    day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other fees apply to the checking features. Fee-free ATM access applies to in-network ATMs only. For
    out-of-network ATMs and bank tellers a $2.50 fee will apply, plus any additional fee that the owner or bank
    may charge. Wealthfront Brokerage may, in its sole discretion, make available to you certain out-of-network
    domestic ATM fee reimbursements for qualifying transactions, provided you meet the eligibility requirements.

    The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for the Cash Account is as of a specific date, and may change at any time. The APY
    for the Wealthfront Cash Account represents the weighted average of the APY on the aggregate deposit balances of all
    clients at the program banks. Deposit balances are not allocated equally among the participating program banks. Cash
    Account is offered by Wealthfront Brokerage. Wealthfront Brokerage conveys Cash Account funds to depository
    institutions that accept and maintain such deposits. The cash balance in the Cash Account is swept to one or more
    banks (the “<a class="static-guest-footer-component-disclosure-link static-guest-common-link-underline"
    href="../programbanks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">

    Savings Plans of Nevada (the “Board”), chaired by the Nevada State Treasurer. Ascensus College Savings Recordkeeping
    Services, LLC (“ACSR”) serves as the Program Manager of the Plan. Wealthfront Advisers serves as the investment

    Before you invest, consider whether your or the beneficiary’s home state offers any state tax or other state
    benefits such as financial aid, scholarship funds, or protection from creditors that are only available for
    investments in that state’s qualified tuition program. You also should consult your financial, tax, or other advisor
    to learn more about how state-based benefits (or any limitations) would apply to your specific circumstances. You
    also may wish to directly contact your home state’s 529 plan(s), or any other 529 plan, to learn more about those
    plans’ features, benefits, and limitations. State-based benefits should be one of many appropriately weighted
    factors to be considered when making an investment decision. Earnings on nonqualified withdrawals are subject to
    federal income tax and may be subject to a 10 percent federal tax penalty, as well as state and local income taxes.
    The availability of tax and other benefits may be contingent on meeting other requirements.
