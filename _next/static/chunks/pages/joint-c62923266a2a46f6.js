Investment risks vary based on individual circumstances not accounted for in this comparison. How do we define risk for our accounts? Wealthfront’s Automated Bond Ladder is considered “Low Risk” as compared to other Wealthfront Accounts. Wealthfront’s Automated Bond Ladder is a portfolio of low-risk US Treasury bonds, which are considered to be among the safest investments as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, though they are not entirely risk-free, and there is a potential for loss of principal if sold prior to maturity. Wealthfront’s Automated Bond Portfolio is considered “Low Risk” as we construct the portfolio to have an expected annualized volatility of approximately 3%. This is roughly half of the expected volatility for the lowest risk versions of our Classic and Socially Responsible Automated Investing Account portfolios. Wealthfront’s Automated Investing Account is optimized to your risk tolerance providing for a Personalized Risk Level. In general, these accounts have a higher level of risk than the Cash Account or Automated Bond Ladder, but because they hold globally diversified portfolios of index funds, they carry less exposure to risk than purely investing in individual stocks like in the S&P 500 Direct Account or the Stock Investing Account. As compared to other Wealthfront Investing Accounts, Wealthfront’s S&P 500 Direct Account is considered “High Risk” as it invests in individual stocks of the S&P 500\xae providing exposure to large-cap US companies across diverse sectors. While the account provides some diversification, it does not include exposure to global asset classes (unlike the Automated Investing Account) and is still subject to potentially significant market volatility, influenced by factors such as the economy, interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events.
